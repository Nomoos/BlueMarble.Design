# Roadmap Milestones

This directory contains milestone definitions and tracking for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Define major project milestones with clear deliverables
- Track progress toward milestone completion
- Document milestone dependencies and timelines

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `milestone-name.md` (e.g., `alpha-release-milestone.md`)
- Include clear success criteria and deliverables
- Define timeline and key dates
- Document dependencies on other milestones

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `core-gameplay-milestone.md` not `milestone1.md`
- Use sequential prefixes if needed: `01-foundation-milestone.md`, `02-alpha-milestone.md`

## Milestone Structure

Each milestone file should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief description and goals
2. **Deliverables**: Specific outputs and requirements
3. **Timeline**: Start date, target completion, actual completion
4. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blockers
5. **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion
6. **Status**: Current progress and remaining work
