# Milestone Guide

This guide describes how to structure and track milestones in the BlueMarble project.

## Milestone Structure

Each milestone should define:
- Goals and objectives
- Success criteria
- Key deliverables
- Timeline and deadlines
- Required resources
- Risk assessment

## Development Phases

The project follows these main phases:

1. **Foundation Design** - Core design documentation and architecture
2. **Core Feature Design** - Essential game systems and mechanics
3. **Advanced Features** - Enhanced gameplay and social features
4. **Polish and Optimization** - Performance tuning and refinement
5. **Launch Preparation** - Final testing and deployment readiness

## Milestone Tracking

Track the following for each milestone:
- Major version milestones
- Feature completion gates
- Design review checkpoints
- Integration milestones
- Quality assurance gates

## Design to Development Flow

1. **Design Phase**: Create and review design documents
2. **Planning Phase**: Estimate effort and plan implementation
3. **Development Phase**: Implement features based on designs
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate against design requirements
5. **Release Phase**: Deploy and monitor

## Document Naming Conventions

- `milestone-[version].md` - Documentation for specific milestones
- `release-plan-[version].md` - Release planning documents
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0, v0.1) for consistency
