# Roadmap Tasks

This directory contains detailed task definitions and feature breakdowns for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Break down features and milestones into actionable tasks
- Document task specifications and requirements
- Track task progress and ownership

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `feature-name.md` (e.g., `inventory-system-tasks.md`)
- Keep files focused on one feature or system
- Include clear task descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Link to related design documents and milestones

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `combat-system-tasks.md` not `feature1.md`
- Group related tasks in a single file or use prefixes

## Task Structure

Each task file should include:

1. **Feature Overview**: Brief description and purpose
2. **Task List**: Detailed breakdown of work items
3. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blockers
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
5. **Estimates**: Time or complexity estimates
6. **Owner**: Assigned person or team
7. **Status**: Current progress

## Task Status

Track task status clearly:
- **Todo**: Not yet started
- **In Progress**: Active work
- **Review**: Awaiting review or approval
- **Done**: Completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
