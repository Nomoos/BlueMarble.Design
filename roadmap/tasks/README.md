# Roadmap Tasks

This directory contains detailed task definitions and feature breakdowns for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Break down features and milestones into actionable tasks
- Document task specifications and requirements

- Link tasks to GitHub issues and sub-issues

## Current Tasks

### Feature Tasks

- [Player Trading Marketplace](player-trading-marketplace.md) - Comprehensive trading system for player economy

- Use descriptive filenames: `feature-name.md` (e.g., `inventory-system-tasks.md`)
- Keep files focused on one feature or system
- Include clear task descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Link to related design documents and milestones

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `combat-system-tasks.md` not `feature1.md`
- Group related tasks in a single file or use prefixes
