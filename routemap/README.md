# Routemap

High-level project roadmap, milestones, and backlog for BlueMarble research and design work.

## Documents

- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) - Big picture by quarter/phase
- [Milestones](milestones.md) - Dated milestones and deliverables
- [Backlog](backlog.md) - Groomed backlog for research/design tasks

## Purpose

The routemap provides:

- **Strategic Direction**: Quarterly/phase-based planning
- **Clear Milestones**: Specific, dated deliverables
