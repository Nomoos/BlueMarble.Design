# Storyboard

This directory contains storyboard files for the StoryGenerator pipeline.

## Purpose

The storyboard stage visualizes scripts by breaking them down into individual frames, shots, and visual sequences.

## Structure

Storyboards should be organized by project:
- `project-name/` - Directory for each storyboard project
  - `storyboard.md` - Main storyboard document
  - `frames/` - Individual frame descriptions or images
  - `notes.md` - Additional notes and annotations

## Usage

1. Storyboards are generated from scripts in the `/script` directory
2. Each storyboard should include:
   - Frame-by-frame breakdowns
   - Visual descriptions
   - Camera angles and movements
   - Audio cues
3. Storyboards guide the asset collection and rendering stages
