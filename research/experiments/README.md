# Research Experiments

This directory contains structured experiment logs documenting hypotheses, methods, results, and decisions.

## Guidelines

- **File naming**: Use date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`
- **One experiment per file**: Keep experiments self-contained
- **Structured format**: Use the experiment report template

## Experiment Report Structure

Each experiment should follow this structure:

1. **Hypothesis**: What are we testing?
2. **Method**: How did we test it?
3. **Results**: What happened?
4. **Interpretation**: What does it mean?
5. **Decision**: What did we decide? (Link to ADR if applicable)

## Template

See [templates/experiment-report.md](../../templates/experiment-report.md) for the full template.
