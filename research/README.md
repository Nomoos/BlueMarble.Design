# BlueMarble Research

This directory contains **all research documentation** for the BlueMarble project, including market analysis, game design research, technical research, and experimental findings.

> **Note**: This is the primary location for **all research activities**. For high-level design vision, see the [/design](../design/) directory. For technical implementation specifications, see the [/docs](../docs/) directory.

## Purpose

The `/research` directory serves as the central hub for:

- **Research Topics**: Small, focused research notes (200-400 lines)
- **Market Research**: Competitive analysis and market trends
- **Game Design Research**: Game mechanics and systems research
- **Technical Research**: Spatial data, algorithms, and technical analysis
- **Experiments**: Structured experiment logs and findings
- **Literature Reviews**: Academic papers and technical documentation analysis
- **Sources**: Bibliography, reading lists, and external references

## Organizational Structure

Research is organized using a **recursive, step-by-step structure** for clarity and progressive detail:

- Each research area begins with an **overview document** outlining the main research steps
- Major steps are organized into **step-N folders** containing detailed documentation
- Complex steps can be **recursively broken down** into sub-steps (step-N.M folders)
- Each level contains **README.md** files providing navigation and summaries

See [RESEARCH_ORGANIZATION.md](RESEARCH_ORGANIZATION.md) for complete organizational guidelines.
