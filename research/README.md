## Research Areas

### Spatial Data Storage (`spatial-data-storage/`)

Comprehensive analysis of spatial data representations and storage strategies for high-resolution global material mapping, including:

- Quad Tree / Octree approaches
- Binary Tree implementations (KD-Tree, BSP)
- Hash-based methods (Spatial Hash, Geohash, S2)
- Raster/Grid systems
- Vector/Boundary representations
- Hybrid approaches for BlueMarble's specific use case

### Game Design (`game-design/`)

Research documentation for transforming BlueMarble into an interactive geological simulation game while maintaining scientific accuracy, including:

- Technical world parameters for 3D spherical planet with 20,000 km height
- Game mechanics inspired by Port Royale 1 and The Guild 1400
- Skill and knowledge system analysis based on major MMORPGs
- Phased development roadmap (16-20 months implementation plan)
- Player freedom analysis emphasizing intelligent constraints
- Integration strategies maintaining backward compatibility with existing architecture

## Integration with BlueMarble Architecture

This research directly supports BlueMarble's:

- **Frontend Spatial Operations**: JavaScript quadtree implementation in `Client/js/modules/utils/geometry-utils.js`
- **Backend Geometry Processing**: C# spatial operations in the Generator project
- **Global Coordinate System**: World-scale geographic data handling
- **Performance Requirements**: Efficient storage for high-resolution terrain data

## Usage

Each research area includes:

1. **Overview**: Introduction to the research topic
2. **Analysis**: Detailed examination of approaches
3. **Current State**: Documentation of existing implementations
4. **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for BlueMarble development

## Contributing

When adding new research:

1. Create a new subdirectory for the research area
2. Include comprehensive README.md with overview
3. Add detailed analysis documents
4. Cross-reference with existing BlueMarble implementations
5. Provide clear recommendations and next steps
