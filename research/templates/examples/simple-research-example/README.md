# Simple Research Example

This directory demonstrates a simple, flat research structure with minimal steps.

## Research Steps Overview

This research is organized in 3 straightforward steps:

1. **[Step 1: Investigation](step-1-investigation/)** - Initial research and problem definition
2. **[Step 2: Analysis](step-2-analysis/)** - Detailed analysis and comparison
3. **[Step 3: Recommendations](step-3-recommendations/)** - Conclusions and actionable guidance

## Overview

This example demonstrates the minimal step-by-step structure for simpler research topics that don't require recursive sub-steps. Each step contains focused documentation on a specific phase of the research.

## When to Use This Structure

Use this flat, 3-5 step structure when:

- Research topic is relatively focused and contained
- No need for recursive breakdown within steps
- Clear linear progression through research phases
- Individual documents are self-contained

## When to Use Recursive Structure

Consider adding sub-steps (like Step 2.1, 2.2, etc.) when:

- A step becomes too complex with many documents
- Natural sub-groupings emerge within a step
- Different researchers work on different aspects
- Need to organize 5+ documents within a single step

## Example Step Organization

### Step 1: Investigation (2-3 documents)
- Problem definition
- Literature review
- Initial findings

### Step 2: Analysis (3-5 documents)
- Comparative analysis
- Data collection
- Metrics and benchmarks

### Step 3: Recommendations (1-3 documents)
- Conclusions
- Implementation guide
- Next steps
