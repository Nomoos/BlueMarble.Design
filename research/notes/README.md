# Research Notes

This directory contains informal research notes and ideas for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Capture initial ideas and brainstorming sessions
- Document quick observations and insights
- Store work-in-progress research before formal write-up

## Guidelines

- Keep files small and focused on one idea (200-400 lines)
- Use descriptive filenames: `idea-name.md` (e.g., `crafting-mechanic-idea.md`)
- Graduate promising notes to formal research in `../topics/` or `../literature/`
- Cross-link related notes and research

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive: `procedural-generation-approach.md` not `notes.md`
- Add dates if time-sensitive: `2025-01-15-market-observation.md`

## Workflow

1. Create a note file for each idea or observation
2. Expand and refine the note as research progresses
3. When substantial, move to `../topics/` for formal research
4. Update `../index.md` when creating significant notes
