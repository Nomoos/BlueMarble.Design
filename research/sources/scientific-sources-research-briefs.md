## Batch 1: Biology and Organic Systems (Sources 1-4)

### Source 1: Decomposition
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition

**Key Facts:**
- Decomposition is the process by which organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter
- Five general stages: fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/remains
- Rate affected by temperature, moisture, oxygen availability, and organism complexity
- Aerobic decomposition (with oxygen) is faster than anaerobic (without oxygen)
- Detritivores (insects, worms) and decomposer organisms (bacteria, fungi) drive the process
- Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles are fundamental to decomposition

**Implications/Risks:**
- Essential for realistic survival crafting: composting, tanning, fermentation
- Time-based decay mechanics require careful balance to avoid tedious gameplay
- Player expectations vs. realism: full decomposition can take months to years
- Performance considerations for tracking decay states of many objects simultaneously
- May need simplified model for gameplay while maintaining scientific plausibility

**Action Items:**
- Define decomposition stages for organic items (food, corpses, plant matter)
- Create time-acceleration model (1 game day = X decomposition progress)
- Implement environmental factors: temperature zones, moisture levels, sealed containers
- Design composting system for agricultural gameplay
- Add fermentation mechanics for food preservation (brewing, pickling)
- Consider scavenger AI interaction with decomposing matter

### Source 2: Corpse Decomposition
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_decomposition

**Key Facts:**
- Human/animal corpse decomposition follows predictable stages: fresh → bloat → active decay → advanced decay → skeletonization
- Bloat stage (2-6 days): gases accumulate, body swells, strong odors
- Active decay (several weeks): most soft tissue consumed by maggots and bacteria
- Advanced decay (weeks to months): remaining soft tissue and cartilage degraded
- Skeletonization timeline varies: months in warm climates, years in cold/dry conditions
- Forensic indicators: body temperature, rigor mortis, livor mortis, insect activity

**Implications/Risks:**
- Death mechanics need realistic corpse handling without being gratuitous
- Potential for mature content ratings if too detailed
- Balance between realism and player comfort/game tone
- Technical challenge: persistent corpse tracking and state transitions
- Scavenger AI and ecology interactions add depth but increase complexity

**Action Items:**
- Define 3-4 simplified corpse states for game (fresh → decomposed → skeletal → despawned)
- Implement corpse looting window with time pressure (degradation affects item quality)
- Add environmental storytelling: corpse states indicate time elapsed or foul play
- Create scavenger attraction mechanics (predators drawn to fresh kills)
- Design burial/cremation systems for corpse disposal
- Add disease risk from handling decomposed remains (infection mechanics)
- Ensure appropriate content warnings if implementing detailed systems

### Source 3: Organ (biology)
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(biology)

**Key Facts:**
- Organs are collections of tissues performing specific functions (heart, liver, lungs, etc.)
- Organ systems work together: circulatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous, etc.
- Organs require specific resources: oxygen, nutrients, stable temperature
- Organ failure leads to cascading health problems and death
- Transplantation requires blood type compatibility and immunosuppression
- Organs have different vulnerabilities and damage responses

**Implications/Risks:**
- Enables sophisticated health/damage systems beyond simple HP bars
- Locational damage: targeting specific organs has different effects

### Source 4: Bacteria
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria

**Key Facts:**
- Single-celled prokaryotic microorganisms found in all environments
- Essential decomposers and nutrient cyclers in ecosystems
- Key roles: nitrogen fixation, fermentation, decomposition, disease
- Rapid reproduction: binary fission every 20 minutes under ideal conditions
- Requires moisture, nutrients, appropriate temperature and pH
- Anaerobic vs. aerobic bacteria thrive in different oxygen conditions
- Some produce antibiotics naturally (basis for penicillin)

**Implications/Risks:**
- Foundation for fermentation/brewing mechanics (beer, wine, cheese, bread)
- Disease/infection systems require bacterial simulation
- Food spoilage and preservation tied to bacterial growth
- Microscopic scale makes direct representation challenging
- Over-complexity risk: players don't need to manage individual bacteria

**Action Items:**

## Batch 1 Summary

The first four sources establish foundational biological systems for BlueMarble's survival and crafting mechanics. **Decomposition** and **corpse decomposition** provide the scientific basis for decay systems, affecting everything from food preservation to battlefield cleanup. **Organ biology** enables sophisticated health and medical systems, allowing for locational damage and advanced surgical gameplay. **Bacteria** ties everything together, driving fermentation crafting, disease mechanics, and agricultural systems.

**Cross-Source Insights:**
- All four sources interconnect: bacteria drive decomposition, affecting organs and entire organisms
- Time-scale balancing is critical: real processes take days to months, but gameplay needs faster feedback
- Environmental factors (temperature, moisture, oxygen) are common variables across all systems
- Medical and survival gameplay can be layered: simple for beginners, complex for specialists

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Food spoilage and preservation (immediate survival impact)
2. Basic wound/infection mechanics (ties to combat)
3. Fermentation crafting (accessible, rewarding)
4. Advanced medical systems (optional depth for dedicated players)

**Next Steps:**
- Process next batch focusing on engineering and materials science

## Batch 2: Biology and Engineering (Sources 5-8)

### Source 5: Scavenger
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger

**Key Facts:**
- Scavengers feed primarily on dead animals (carrion) rather than hunting live prey
- Key ecological role: nutrient recycling, disease control, carcass removal
- Types: obligate scavengers (vultures, condors) vs. facultative scavengers (crows, hyenas, bears)
- Scavengers often have specialized adaptations: keen sense of smell, strong digestive systems, social feeding behaviors
- Competition hierarchy: large predators → large scavengers → small scavengers → insects
- Carcass depletion timeline: hours to days depending on scavenger population and carcass size

**Implications/Risks:**
- Adds ecological depth to wildlife systems and food chains
- Natural corpse cleanup mechanism (player kills, NPC deaths, wildlife deaths)
- Risk of trivializing death if scavengers remove corpses too quickly
- Performance overhead for scavenger AI detection and pathfinding to corpses
- Player exploitation potential: intentional kills to attract scavengers for harvesting

**Action Items:**
- Implement scavenger AI: detection radius for corpses, preference for fresh vs. decomposed
- Create scavenger species hierarchy: vultures (aerial), hyenas (ground), insects (final cleanup)
- Design scavenger loot tables: bones, hide scraps, meat (lower quality than fresh kills)
- Add scavenger-player interactions: aggressive defense of food, flee if threatened
- Balance corpse cleanup timing: enough time for player looting, but automatic cleanup
- Consider scavenger attractions as hunting strategy (bait traps, ambush predators)
- Implement disease transmission risk from scavenger-consumed carrion

### Source 6: Structural Integrity and Failure
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_integrity_and_failure

**Key Facts:**
- Structural integrity: ability of a structure to withstand intended loads without failure
- Failure modes: yielding (permanent deformation), fracture (breaking), buckling (collapse), fatigue (repeated stress)
- Load types: dead load (self-weight), live load (occupants, furniture), environmental (wind, snow, earthquakes)
- Safety factor: structures designed to handle multiples of expected load (typically 1.5-3x)
- Material properties critical: tensile strength, compressive strength, shear strength, elasticity
- Progressive collapse: localized failure spreads to entire structure (critical in large buildings)

**Implications/Risks:**
- Foundation for realistic building and crafting durability systems
- Enables siege warfare mechanics: structural weak points, progressive damage
- Complexity risk: over-simulation may bog down performance or confuse players
- Player frustration if structures fail unexpectedly without clear feedback
- Griefing potential: players intentionally triggering structural failures

**Action Items:**
- Implement load calculation system: weight of materials, occupants, stored items
- Define structural integrity score: health percentage, failure thresholds
- Create visual feedback: cracks, stress indicators, material strain effects
- Design failure modes: partial collapse, complete collapse, slow degradation

- Balance realism with gameplay: simplified load calculations, warning signs before failure
- Create repair/reinforcement mechanics: bracing, material upgrades, foundation work

---

### Source 7: Structural Load
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load

**Key Facts:**
- Dead loads: permanent/static (building materials, fixed equipment) - predictable and constant
- Live loads: temporary/dynamic (people, furniture, snow, stored goods) - variable and location-dependent
- Environmental loads: wind pressure, seismic forces, snow accumulation, temperature changes
- Point loads vs. distributed loads: concentrated weight vs. spread across area
- Load paths: how forces transfer through structure to foundation (critical for design)
- Dynamic loads: impact, vibration, moving loads (more damaging than static equivalents)

**Implications/Risks:**
- More detailed companion to structural integrity - focuses on load sources
- Enables realistic storage and building capacity limits
- Risk of tedious micromanagement if players must calculate loads constantly
- Opportunity for emergent gameplay: overloading storage causes collapse
- Balance challenge: realism vs. fun (players want to build, not calculate)

**Action Items:**
- Define material load capacities: wood beams support X kg, stone pillars support Y kg
- Implement storage weight limits: chests, shelves, warehouses have capacity
- Create building occupancy limits: floors can support N players/NPCs simultaneously
- Add environmental load events: snowstorms add load, earthquakes stress structures
- Design load visualization: color-coded stress overlays in build mode
- Implement load distribution: weight spreads to adjacent supports
- Add dynamic load effects: rapid movement, impacts stress structures differently
- Create load-based crafting challenges: bridges must support carts, towers need foundations
