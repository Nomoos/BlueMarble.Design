## Usage Workflow

### Adding a New Source

1. **Identify Source**
   - Found during literature review
   - Referenced in existing documents
   - Discovered through research

2. **Add to Bibliography**
   ```bash
   # Edit sources.bib
   vim research/sources/sources.bib
   # Add BibTeX entry in appropriate category
   ```

3. **Add to Reading List**
   ```bash
   # Edit reading-list.md
   vim research/sources/reading-list.md
   # Add under appropriate priority section
   ```

4. **For Survival Collections**
   ```bash
   # Edit survival-sources.md
   vim research/sources/survival-sources.md
   # Add download information and tracking details
   ```

5. **Create Analysis Document** (if analyzing)
   ```bash
   # Create in research/literature/
   vim research/literature/[topic]-analysis.md
   # Follow analysis document template
   ```
