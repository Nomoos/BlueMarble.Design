### Source 3: Path of Exile: Designing Sustainable Loot - GDC Talk

**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### Source Information

**Title:** Path of Exile: Designing Sustainable Loot Systems  
**Source:** GDC Talk by Grinding Gear Games  
**URL:** gdcvault.com  
**Discovered From:** Phase 3 Planning - Economy Focus

#### Rationale

Path of Exile's loot system represents a unique approach where loot is the primary material source and currency items serve as both crafting materials (sink) and trade medium. Their seasonal economy resets prevent economic stagnation while maintaining player engagement. This model is highly relevant for BlueMarble's loot and crafting systems.

#### Key Topics to Cover

- Loot as primary material source
- Currency items as material sinks (crafting orbs)
- Trade league vs. SSF (self-found) economies
- Seasonal economy resets (challenge leagues)
- Preventing economic stagnation
- Loot generation algorithms
- Crafting as material consumption
- Player trading without auction house
- Economic balance across leagues
- Rare item value preservation

#### BlueMarble Application

- Loot drop system design
- Currency/crafting material dual purpose
- Seasonal events and economy resets
- Crafting material consumption mechanics
- Player trading system without centralized market
- Economic freshness strategies

#### Deliverable

Comprehensive analysis document (minimum 400-600 lines, target 1000+) covering:
- Executive summary of Path of Exile's economy model
- Loot-based material source analysis
- Currency items as material sinks
- Seasonal economy reset strategies
- Trade system design (no auction house)
- Economic balance validation
- Code examples for loot generation and crafting
- Cross-references to other loot-based economies

### Source 4: Albion Online: Player-Driven Economy Design

**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 hours

#### Source Information

**Title:** Albion Online: Player-Driven Economy Design  
**Author:** Sandbox Interactive  
**Publisher/URL:** albiononline.com, developer blogs  
**Discovered From:** Phase 3 Planning - Economy Focus

#### Rationale

Albion Online features a full-loot PvP MMORPG with a completely player-driven economy. Every item is player-crafted, and full-loot PvP creates massive material sinks. Their territory control system ties resource generation to player politics. This represents an extreme but successful model for material sources and sinks.

#### Key Topics to Cover

- Material sources (gathering, refining, crafting)
- Material sinks (full-loot PvP, gear degradation)
- 100% player-crafted economy
- Territory control and resource generation
- Economic balance through loss (PvP destruction)
- Gathering and refining specialization
- Resource distribution across territories
- Market system design (localized markets)
- Economic impacts of guild warfare
- Gear tier progression and economy

#### BlueMarble Application

- Full-loot PvP economic implications
- Territory-based resource generation
- Player crafting dependency chains
- Localized markets and trade routes
- Economic balance through destruction
- Resource specialization systems

#### Deliverable

Comprehensive analysis document (minimum 400-600 lines, target 1000+) covering:
- Executive summary of Albion's player-driven model
- Material sources analysis (gathering to crafting)
- Material sinks analysis (full-loot emphasis)
- Territory control and resources
- Economic balance through PvP loss
