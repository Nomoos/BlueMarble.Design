Level 1: Game Elements (Components)
↓ What exists in the game
↓
Level 2: Behavioral Cues (Affordances)
↓ What elements signal to players
↓
Level 3: Player Actions (Behavior)
↓ What players can and do
↓
Level 4: Game Systems (Mechanics)
↓ How actions affect game state

## Key Findings

### 1. Action Theory and Game Design

#### Purposeful Action Framework

**Von Cranach's Action Theory:**

Actions have hierarchical structure:
- **Goal**: Desired end state (identify mineral)
- **Plan**: Strategy to achieve goal (systematic testing)
- **Execution**: Specific movements (tool usage)
- **Monitoring**: Tracking progress (test results)
- **Evaluation**: Assessing success (correct identification)

**Game Design Implications:**

1. **Clear Goals**: Players need to understand desired outcomes
2. **Actionable Plans**: Provide means to achieve goals
3. **Responsive Execution**: Actions must feel responsive
4. **Visible Progress**: Show players they're advancing
5. **Meaningful Evaluation**: Communicate success/failure clearly

**BlueMarble Implementation:**

```markdown
## Action Framework: Mineral Identification

Goal Definition:
- Primary: Correctly identify mineral sample
- Secondary: Build identification expertise
- Tertiary: Complete mineral database

Plan Provision:
- Tutorial: "Test hardness, then color, then streak"
- Guidance: Visual flowchart showing process
- Hints: Context-sensitive suggestions

Execution Support:
- Responsive tool interactions
- Clear visual feedback
- Intuitive control scheme
- Forgiving error tolerance

Progress Monitoring:
- Test result display (immediate)
- Partial identification indicators
- Confidence level meter
- Database completion percentage

Success Evaluation:
- Correct identification celebration
- Experience points awarded
- New knowledge unlocked
- Skill improvement shown
```

#### Action Levels

**Three Action Levels (von Cranach):**

1. **Gross Actions**: High-level activities
   - Example: "Survey this geological area"
   - BlueMarble: "Conduct mineral exploration"

2. **Strategic Actions**: Mid-level steps
   - Example: "Identify rock formations"
   - BlueMarble: "Perform hardness tests"

3. **Functional Actions**: Low-level operations
   - Example: "Scratch rock with tool"
   - BlueMarble: "Apply pressure with knife"

**Design Considerations:**

- **Gross actions** provide overall purpose
- **Strategic actions** offer meaningful choices
- **Functional actions** deliver tactile satisfaction
- **All levels** must communicate clearly

**BlueMarble Action Hierarchy:**

```markdown
## Hierarchical Actions: Geological Expedition

Gross Level: Expedition Planning
Actions:
- Choose exploration zone
- Prepare equipment loadout
- Set expedition objectives
- Allocate time/resources

Strategic Level: Field Operations
Actions:
- Locate promising formations
- Select sampling sites
- Conduct field tests
- Collect representative samples

Functional Level: Sample Handling
Actions:
- Strike rock with hammer
- Observe fracture surfaces
- Test hardness with tools
- Record visual characteristics

Each Level Purpose:
→ Gross: Provides overall direction and motivation
→ Strategic: Offers meaningful decision-making
→ Functional: Delivers satisfying interaction
```

### 2. Semiotic Analysis of Game Elements

#### Game Signs and Meaning

**Three Sign Types (Peirce):**

1. **Icon**: Resembles what it represents
   - Example: Rock image looks like actual rock
   - BlueMarble: Mineral visualization matches reality

2. **Index**: Indicates through causation
   - Example: Smoke indicates fire
   - BlueMarble: Surface color indicates mineral type

3. **Symbol**: Arbitrary cultural association
   - Example: Red = danger, green = safe
   - BlueMarble: Equipment icons, UI symbols

**Design Application:**

```markdown
## Semiotic Design: BlueMarble Elements

Icons (Visual Resemblance):
- Rock textures match geological samples
- Crystal structures show authentic forms
- Equipment models resemble real tools
- Landscapes reflect actual formations

Indexes (Causal Indicators):
- Weathering patterns → Age/exposure
- Color variations → Mineral content
- Crystal size → Cooling rate
- Layering → Depositional history

Symbols (Cultural Conventions):
- Star icon → High value mineral
- Checkmark → Identified correctly
- Lock icon → Requires higher skill
- Exclamation → Important discovery

Design Principles:
→ Prefer icons for intuitive recognition
→ Use indexes for educational value
→ Apply symbols consistently
→ Avoid ambiguous signs
```

#### Affordances and Behavioral Cues

**Gibson's Affordances:**

Objects offer action possibilities:
- Rock affords striking (hardness test)
- Tool affords grasping (equipment use)
- Container affords filling (sample storage)
- Surface affords scratching (streak test)

**Norman's Signifiers:**

Design elements signal affordances:
- Visual cues indicate interactivity
- Feedback confirms actions
- Constraints guide behavior
- Mappings show relationships

**BlueMarble Affordance Design:**

```markdown
## Affordance System: Geological Tools

Rock Hammer:
Affordances (actual capabilities):
- Can break rocks
- Can test hardness
- Can expose fresh surfaces
- Can be repaired/replaced

Signifiers (design communication):
- Icon shows hammer shape (recognizable)
- Cursor changes near usable rocks (interactivity)
- Durability bar shows condition (state feedback)
- Animation shows proper usage (instruction)

Sample Container:
Affordances:
- Can store mineral samples
- Has limited capacity
- Preserves sample quality
- Can be organized

Signifiers:
- Icon shows container (recognition)
- Fill level indicator (capacity feedback)
- Quality color coding (state communication)
- Organization interface (management capability)

Design Goals:
→ Make affordances discoverable
→ Provide clear signifiers
→ Give immediate feedback
→ Support learning through use
```

### 3. Methodological Framework

#### Game Analysis Methods

**Behavioral Observation:**

Systematic observation of:
- What actions players take
- When/why actions occur
- How actions chain together
- What actions are avoided

**Action Mapping:**

Document complete action space:
- List all possible actions
- Identify action prerequisites
- Map action consequences
- Analyze action patterns

**Semiotic Analysis:**

Evaluate game communication:
- Identify signs and meanings
- Assess clarity/ambiguity
- Check cultural appropriateness
- Test player understanding

**BlueMarble Analysis Example:**

```markdown
## Analysis: Mineral Identification System

Behavioral Observation:
Questions:
- Do players test systematically or randomly?
- Which tests do players perform first?
- When do players consult reference materials?
- What causes identification errors?

Observation Method:
- Screen recording with think-aloud protocol
- Action logging in game analytics
- Post-session interviews
- Pattern analysis across players

Action Mapping:
Available Actions:
1. Visual inspection
2. Hardness test
3. Streak test  
4. Specific gravity test
5. Acid test
6. Consult field guide
7. Submit identification

Action Prerequisites:
- Hardness test requires appropriate tool
- Streak test requires streak plate
- Specific gravity requires scale and water
- Field guide requires discovery of minerals

Action Consequences:
- Tests provide diagnostic information
- Correct identification awards XP
- Errors provide corrective feedback
- Repeated testing improves skill

Semiotic Analysis:
Icon Effectiveness:
✓ Hammer icon clearly indicates hardness test
✓ Color samples show streak results
? Specific gravity scale may need tutorial
✗ Acid reaction needs better visualization

Feedback Clarity:
✓ Success/failure immediately obvious
✓ Partial identification progress shown
? Confidence level interpretation unclear
✗ Why identification failed not communicated

Recommendations:
→ Add tutorial for gravity testing
→ Improve acid reaction animation
→ Clarify confidence level meaning
→ Provide explanation for failures
```
