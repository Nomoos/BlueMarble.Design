## Overview

The Stargate franchise (1994 film, SG-1, Atlantis, Universe) features multiple parasitic and symbiotic life forms that offer rich inspiration for game design, particularly for parasitic player character mechanics. This document analyzes these species, their biology, culture, and mechanics, extracting game design applications for the BlueMarble project's parasitic character concept.

## The Goa'uld: Dominant Parasites

### Biology and Physical Form

**Natural State** (Larval/Symbiote Form):
- Aquatic serpentine creatures, approximately 30-50 cm long
- Segmented body with fin-like appendages
- Phosphorescent patterns along body
- Can survive in water or moist environments indefinitely
- Must have host for full cognitive development and power
- Young (prim'ta) incubated in Jaffa pouches

**Host Integration**:
- Enters through mouth or neck incision
- Wraps around spinal column
- Integrates with brainstem and spinal cord
- Forms neural connection within seconds
- Complete control established within minutes
- Can burrow into neck to emerge when needed

**Physical Enhancements to Host**:
- Superhuman strength (can lift several hundred pounds)
- Enhanced healing (rapid wound closure, disease immunity)
- Extended lifespan (thousands of years)
- Resistance to toxins and radiation
- Enhanced reflexes and stamina
- No need for sleep (symbiote can rest while host is active)

**Distinctive Features**:
- Glowing eyes (naquadah-based, golden or red)
- Metallic voice (dual vocal cords, resonant effect)
- Hand device (ribbon device) integration
- Personal shield technology compatibility
- Sarcophagus compatibility for resurrection

### Psychology and Culture

**Personality Traits**:
- Extreme arrogance (believe themselves gods)
- Megalomaniacal tendencies
- Highly intelligent and strategic
- Patient (think in terms of centuries)
- Ruthless and manipulative
- Genetic memory inheritance (all ancestors' knowledge)

**The System Lords**:
- Feudal hierarchy of most powerful Goa'uld
- Constant power struggles and alliances
- Territory and resource control
- Individual System Lords rule sectors of galaxy
- Ancient Egyptian, Sumerian, Mayan god personas

**Host Relationship**:
- **Complete Suppression**: Host consciousness pushed aside
- **Aware but Helpless**: Host can perceive but not act
- **No Consent**: Always involuntary possession
- **Permanent**: Removal typically kills host (unless special circumstances)

**Cultural Practices**:
- Taking hosts as symbol of power
- Collecting human hosts (especially attractive ones)
- Breeding programs for superior hosts
- Jaffa servant warrior race (incubate young)
- Technology scavenging from ancient races

### Technology Integration

**Symbiote-Specific Tech**:
- **Hand Device**: Psychic weapon, torture device, telekinesis
- **Healing Device**: Advanced medical technology

## Game Balance Considerations

### Power Scaling

**Parasite Advantages**:
- Enhanced physical abilities
- Extended lifespan
- Advanced technology access
- Genetic memory knowledge
- Rapid healing

**Balancing Mechanics**:
- Vulnerability during host transfer
- Dependency on naquadah/resources
- Social stigma and hunted status
- Internal conflict (if cooperative)
- Technology requirements
- Feeding requirements (if Wraith-like)

**Progression Limitations**:
```
Level Caps by Host Quality:
- Poor Host: Level 20 cap
- Average Host: Level 50 cap
- Good Host: Level 75 cap
- Excellent Host: Level 90 cap
- Perfect Host: Level 100 cap

Reasoning: Encourages host switching
```

### PvP Considerations

**Parasite vs. Normal Players**:
- Higher base stats
- Technology advantages
- BUT: More obvious (glowing eyes)
- Higher bounty/target priority
- Faction hostility from some groups
- Resource dependencies

**Parasite vs. Parasite**:
- Technology cancels out
- Host quality matters
- Experience (genetic memory) factor
- Tactical approach differences
- Factional allegiances
