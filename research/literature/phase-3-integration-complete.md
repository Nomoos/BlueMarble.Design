## Recommended Research Approach

### Approach A: Sequential (Phase 3 → Phase 3 Extension → Phase 4)
1. Complete Groups 41-46 (original Phase 3)
2. Complete Groups 47-50 (Phase 3 extension)
3. Begin Phase 4 with remaining discoveries

**Timeline:** ~35-45 weeks total  
**Benefit:** Comprehensive, thorough coverage

### Approach B: Parallel (Phase 3 + Extension simultaneously)
1. Process Groups 41-46 and 47-50 in parallel
2. Leverage theoretical/practical synergies
3. Phase 4 with new discoveries from both

**Timeline:** ~20-28 weeks total  
**Benefit:** Faster completion, integrated learning

### Approach C: Focused (Phase 3 only, reserve rest for Phase 4)
1. Complete Groups 41-46 only
2. Skip Groups 47-50 for now
3. Large Phase 4 with all 25 discovered sources

**Timeline:** ~10-14 weeks Phase 3, ~12-15 weeks Phase 4  
**Benefit:** Maintains original Phase 3 scope, clean Phase 4

### Short-term
1. Begin Group 41 (Critical Economy Foundations)
2. Optionally begin Group 47 (Advanced Economy Research) in parallel
3. Process sources following batch workflow

### Long-term
1. Complete selected Phase 3 groups
2. Decide Phase 4 scope based on discoveries
3. Begin implementation with research foundation

## Integration Notes

**Flexibility:**
- All three options are available simultaneously
- Can mix approaches (e.g., use some sources from Option 2, reserve others for Option 3)
- Recommendations are guidelines, not requirements

**Synergies:**
- Groups 41 + 47: Critical economy foundations (theoretical + practical)
- Groups 42 + 48: Economy case studies (classic + modern)
- Groups 43 + 49: Design & balance (standard + extreme)
- Groups 44/45 + 50: Technical (performance + analytics)

**Quality Standards:**
- All groups follow established format
- 400-600 line minimum per source analysis
- Target 1000+ lines for comprehensive coverage
- BlueMarble-specific applications required
