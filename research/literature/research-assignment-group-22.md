# Research Assignment Group 22

**Assignment Type:** Online Game Development Resources Analysis  
**Source File:** `research/literature/online-game-dev-resources.md`  
**Total Topics:** 2  
**Priority Mix:** Critical, Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12h  
**Target Completion:** 1-2 weeks

## Overview

This assignment group focuses on analyzing game development resources from the online catalog. These sources were identified in `online-game-dev-resources.md` and require full research analysis.

## Topics

### 1. Network Programming for Games: Real-Time Multiplayer Systems (Critical)

**Original Status:** ⏳ Pending Analysis  
**Source Location:** `research/literature/online-game-dev-resources.md`  

**Research Tasks:**
1. Read/review the complete source material
2. Extract key concepts relevant to BlueMarble MMORPG
3. Document technical approaches and patterns
4. Identify implementation recommendations
5. Note any additional sources discovered

**Deliverable:**
- Create comprehensive analysis document in `research/literature/`
- Filename: `game-dev-analysis-network-programming-for-games-real-time-multiplaye.md`
- Minimum length: 400-600 lines
- Include: Executive Summary, Core Concepts, BlueMarble Application, Implementation Recommendations, References

### 2. Massively Multiplayer Game Development (Series) (Critical)

**Original Status:** ⏳ Pending Analysis  
**Source Location:** `research/literature/online-game-dev-resources.md`  

**Research Tasks:**
1. Read/review the complete source material
2. Extract key concepts relevant to BlueMarble MMORPG
3. Document technical approaches and patterns
4. Identify implementation recommendations
5. Note any additional sources discovered

**Deliverable:**
- Create comprehensive analysis document in `research/literature/`
- Filename: `game-dev-analysis-massively-multiplayer-game-development-series.md`
- Minimum length: 400-600 lines
- Include: Executive Summary, Core Concepts, BlueMarble Application, Implementation Recommendations, References

## Quality Standards
