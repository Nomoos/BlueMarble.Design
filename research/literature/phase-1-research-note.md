**Document Type:** Research Note  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Phase:** 1  
**Total Topics:** 68 (67 active + 1 reserved)  
**Total Groups:** 40  
**Created:** 2025-01-17

## Research Question

How can 68 research topics be efficiently organized and tracked across 40 parallel groups for Phase 1?

## Research Type

Literature Review and Organizational Planning

## Context

The BlueMarble project requires distributing 68 research topics among 40 groups for parallel investigation. Each group is responsible for 1-2 topics, and findings will inform Phase 2 planning. The distribution includes:

- **28 topics** from the master research queue (Groups 1-20)
- **40 topics** from online game development resources catalog (Groups 21-40)
- **1 reserved slot** for discovered sources during research (Group 20)

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Successful Distribution Strategy

The 68 topics have been successfully organized across 40 parallel groups with the following structure:

- **Groups 1-20**: Original master queue topics (28 topics total, Group 20 reserved)
- **Groups 21-40**: Online game development resources (40 topics total)
- Each group contains 1-2 topics maximum to minimize merge conflicts
- All groups can work in parallel without blocking each other

**Priority Distribution:**
- Critical: 11 topics (16%)
- High: 36 topics (53%)
- Medium: 16 topics (24%)
- Low: 3 topics (4%)
- Very Low: 1 topic (1%)
- Reserved: 1 slot (1%)

### Finding 2: Clear Assignment Structure

Each group has a dedicated assignment file in `research/literature/research-assignment-group-[01-40].md` that contains:

- Clear topic definitions and priorities
- Estimated effort (4-16 hours per group)
- Specific deliverables
- Quality standards
- Progress tracking checklists
- Source discovery logging

### Finding 3: Workload Balance

Groups are balanced for parallel completion:

- **1 week completion**: Groups 16-20 (2-4 hours each)
- **1-2 weeks completion**: Groups 11-15, 36-40 (4-8 hours each)
- **2 weeks completion**: Groups 1-10, 21-35 (8-16 hours each)

Total estimated effort: 180-250 hours across all groups (4.5-6.25 hours per group average)

This document provides:
- Complete group summaries
- Priority distribution tables
- Workload balancing information
- Parallel execution strategy
- Progress tracking guidelines

## Instructions for Child Issues

**IMPORTANT**: Each child issue (Group 01 through Group 40) must process sources from their respective assignment file.

### Step-by-Step Process for Each Group

1. **Locate Your Assignment File**
   - Navigate to `research/literature/research-assignment-group-[NUMBER].md`
   - Example: Group 01 uses `research-assignment-group-01.md`

2. **Review Your Topics**
   - Read the "Topics" section in your assignment file
   - Note the priority level, estimated effort, and focus areas
   - Review the specific deliverables required

3. **Process Sources**
   - Follow the research process outlined in your assignment file:
     - Source Review (30% of time)
     - Analysis (40% of time)
     - Documentation (30% of time)

4. **Create Deliverables**
   - Create analysis documents in `research/literature/`
   - Use naming convention: `game-dev-analysis-[topic].md` or `survival-content-extraction-[topic].md`
   - Include proper YAML front matter
   - Meet minimum length requirements specified in your assignment

5. **Track Progress**
   - Update the "Progress Tracking" checklist in your assignment file
   - Log any newly discovered sources in the "New Sources Discovery" section
   - Follow the discovery template provided

6. **Submit Work**
   - Ensure all documents are in `research/literature/`
   - Verify kebab-case naming
   - Check front matter is complete
   - Confirm cross-references are added
   - Update master research queue

### Quality Standards

All groups must meet these standards:

- **Minimum Length**: As specified per topic (varies by priority)
- **Code Examples**: Include where relevant
- **Citations**: Proper attribution of sources
- **Cross-References**: Link to related research documents
- **Front Matter**: Include YAML front matter with metadata

### Source Discovery

During research, you may discover additional sources. Log them in your assignment file using this template:

```markdown
**Source Name:** [Title of discovered source]
**Discovered From:** [Which topic led to this discovery]
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low - your assessment]
**Category:** [GameDev-Tech/GameDev-Design/GameDev-Content/Survival/etc.]
**Rationale:** [Why this source is relevant to BlueMarble]
**Estimated Effort:** [Hours needed for analysis]
```

These discoveries will inform Phase 2 planning.

## Implications for Phase 2

### Planning Recommendations

1. **Collect Discoveries**
   - Aggregate all discovered sources from Groups 1-40
   - Validate priority assessments
   - Categorize by topic area

2. **Balance Next Phase**
   - Use the same 40-group structure for consistency
   - Maintain 1-2 topics per group
   - Distribute discoveries evenly across groups

3. **Use Template**
   - Apply `research-assignment-template-phase-2.md` for new assignments
   - Follow the balancing algorithm provided
   - Maintain isolation to prevent merge conflicts

4. **Track Lineage**
   - Link Phase 2 sources back to Phase 1 origins
   - Document discovery chains
   - Update master research queue with relationships

### Efficiency Improvements

Based on Phase 1 organization:

- **Parallel Work**: 40 groups working simultaneously
- **Minimal Conflicts**: Each group has unique deliverables
- **Clear Ownership**: Single assignee per group
- **Flexible Completion**: Groups can finish at different paces
- **Buffer Capacity**: Group 20 available for urgent discoveries

### Success Metrics

Phase 1 success will be measured by:

- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of groups finished
- **Discovery Rate**: Number of new sources found per group
- **Quality**: Documents meeting length and content standards
- **Cross-References**: Network of linked research documents
- **Timeline**: Groups finishing within 1-2 week target

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### Open Questions

1. How many new sources will be discovered during Phase 1?
2. What priority distribution will Phase 2 discoveries have?
3. Should Group 20 be used during Phase 1 or saved for Phase 2?
4. How will we handle conflicts if multiple groups discover the same source?

### Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor progress across all 40 groups
- [ ] Track discovered sources in each group's assignment file
- [ ] Aggregate discoveries weekly for Phase 2 planning
- [ ] Update master research queue as groups complete
- [ ] Begin Phase 2 planning when 80% of groups complete
- [ ] Use Phase 2 template to create new assignments
- [ ] Maintain 40-group parallel structure for Phase 2
