## Executive Summary

Runescape (launched 2001) and Old School Runescape (launched 2013) represent one of the longest-running and most successful player-driven economies in MMORPG history. Over 20+ years, Jagex has refined their economic systems through continuous iteration, learning what works and what doesn't. This analysis examines Runescape's material sources (skill-based gathering, monster drops), material sinks (item degradation, high alchemy, consumables), and the Grand Exchange automated market system.

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Skill-Based Economy** - All resources generated through player skills (no NPC vendors selling resources)
2. **The Grand Exchange** - Automated limit order book market with price transparency
3. **Item Degradation** - Equipment loses charges and eventually degrades to dust
4. **High Alchemy** - Gold sink that provides price floor for items
5. **No Pay-to-Win** - Economy integrity maintained despite monetization pressure
6. **Two Game Versions** - RS3 (modern) and OSRS (classic) provide economic experiments
7. **Bot Fighting** - 20+ years of anti-bot development and enforcement

**BlueMarble Applications:**

- Skill-based gathering with achievement milestones creates long-term progression
- Item degradation with charge systems balances powerful equipment
- Grand Exchange-style automated market reduces friction while maintaining economy
- High alchemy-equivalent provides price stability for crafted goods
- Dual currency system (gold + platinum tokens) handles high-value trades
- Resource respawn mechanics that scale with world population
- Death mechanics that balance PvP risk with player retention

**Key Takeaways for BlueMarble:**

1. **Player-driven production works** - 20+ years proves NPC vendors aren't necessary
2. **Automated markets succeed** - Grand Exchange shows convenience doesn't kill economy
3. **Multiple degradation models** - Different item tiers need different sink strategies
4. **Skill progression creates depth** - 99 levels × 23 skills = thousands of hours content
5. **Death penalties evolved** - Balance risk with fun through iteration
6. **Bot fighting never ends** - Build detection systems from day one

## Core Systems Analysis

### 1. Skill-Based Material Sources

Runescape's economy is built on 23 skills that generate or transform resources:

**Gathering Skills (Primary Faucets):**
- Mining: Ore extraction from rocks
- Woodcutting: Logs from trees  
- Fishing: Fish from fishing spots
- Farming: Crops grown over real-time
- Hunter: Animal products

**Production Skills (Transformation + Sink):**
- Smithing: Ore → Equipment
- Crafting: Hides → Armor
- Cooking: Raw food → Cooked food
- Herblore: Herbs → Potions
- Fletching: Logs → Bows/Arrows
- Construction: Planks → Furniture

**Key Design:**
- Every material comes from player activity
- Skills have 99 levels (exponential XP curve)
- Higher level = faster gathering + access to rare resources
- Level requirements create natural market segmentation

**Economic Impact:**
- Creates specialist players (pure miners, pure fishers)
- Scarcity is real (no infinite NPC stocks)
- Supply responds to demand dynamically
- Bot problem directly impacts prices (players notice)

### 2. The Grand Exchange

**Launched:** November 2007  
**Purpose:** Replace player-run trading (which was chaotic and time-consuming)

**How It Works:**

1. **Limit Order Book System**
   - Players post buy orders (max price they'll pay)
   - Players post sell orders (min price they'll accept)
   - System automatically matches orders
   - Trades execute at seller's price (fair to seller)

2. **Price Transparency**
   - Current price visible (last trade price)
   - Historical price graphs (30+ days)
   - Price alerts for significant changes

3. **Trading Limits**
   - Each item has 4-hour buy limit
   - Example: 10,000 cannonballs per 4 hours
   - Prevents market manipulation/cornering
   - Limit varies by item rarity

4. **8 Trading Slots**
   - Players have 8 concurrent order slots
   - Orders persist offline
   - Can collect completed trades anytime

**Economic Benefits:**
- Reduced trading time (more gameplay time)
- Price discovery (fair market prices)
- Liquidity (always buyers and sellers)
- Anti-manipulation (buy limits)

**Trade-Offs:**
- Removed geographic trading  
- Reduced social trading interactions
- Some manipulation still possible

### 3. Item Degradation Systems

Runescape uses multiple degradation models:

**Model A: Charge-Based (Barrows Equipment)**
- 100,000 charges = ~15 hours combat
- Repairable at NPC for gold
- Repair cost scales with damage %
- Can use while degraded

**Model B: Degrade to Dust (Chaotic Equipment)**
- 30,000 charges of use
- Cannot be repaired
- Disappears at 0 charges
- Must be replaced entirely

**Model C: Component System (Invention Skill)**
- Uses divine charges (player-crafted)
- Charges consumed during any use
- Creates demand for energy materials

**Economic Impact:**
- Perpetual demand for equipment
- Gold sinks (repair costs)
- Material sinks (divine charge crafting)
- High-end gear has real maintenance cost

### 4. High Alchemy - Price Floor

**Mechanic:** 
- Cast High Alchemy spell on item
- Item destroyed, player receives 60% of shop price
- Requires magic runes (material cost)

**Economic Function:**
- Provides minimum price floor for items
- If market price < alchemy value, players alch
- Prevents complete market crashes
- Creates demand for runes

**Balance:**
- Generates gold (inflationary)
- Consumes items (deflationary)
- Consumes runes (material sink)
- Net effect: slight inflation, market stability

### 5. Death and Risk Systems

**Evolution Over 20 Years:**

**2001-2007: Harsh System**
- Drop all items on death
- 2 minutes to return
- Problem: Server lag caused unfair deaths

**2007-2015: Gravestones**
- Items held in gravestone
- Various tiers (30min to 7 days)
- Problem: Too safe, reduced item sinks

**2015-Present: Reclaim System**
- Items held for 1 hour
- Pay fee to reclaim (based on item value)
- Items lost if not reclaimed
- Balanced risk/reward

**Current Wilderness (PvP Zone):**
- Keep 3-4 most valuable items
- Rest dropped for killer
- Creates real risk/reward
- Drives economy through item destruction

## Lessons for BlueMarble

### 1. Skill Progression Creates Long-Term Goals

**Runescape's Success:**
- 99 levels per skill = 300+ hours each
- 23 skills = 7,000+ hours for max
- Skill capes reward achievement
- Constant sense of progression

**BlueMarble Application:**
- Deep skill trees for all activities
- Visible progression (levels, ranks)
- Cosmetic rewards (skill mastery items)
- Specialization paths (master miner vs generalist)

### 2. Automated Markets Work When Done Right

**Grand Exchange Proves:**
- Convenience doesn't kill player economy
- Price transparency builds trust
- Buy limits prevent manipulation
- Offline trading increases participation

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**
- Implement GE-style system as primary market
- Add regional specialties for geographic gameplay
- Include buy limits on strategic items
- Provide price history and trend data

### 3. Multiple Degradation Models Serve Different Needs

**Runescape Shows:**
- Repairable gear: Casual-friendly, steady sink
- Degrade-to-dust: Aggressive sink, high-end content
- Component system: Flexible, drives crafting demand

**BlueMarble Strategy:**
- Low-tier gear: Repairable (friendly to new players)
- Mid-tier gear: Charge-based (balance of convenience and cost)
- High-tier gear: Component/dust (significant sink)
- PvP gear: Full loss (creates market demand)

### 4. Death Penalties Must Evolve

**Runescape's Journey:**
- Too harsh → players quit
- Too lenient → no item sink, no excitement
- Current balance → recoverable with fee (gold sink) + time limit

**BlueMarble Design:**
- Zone-based risk levels (safe → extreme)
- Recoverable items with fees (currency sink)
- Time limits create urgency
- Player choice in risk/reward

### 5. Bot Fighting Requires Constant Evolution

**Runescape's 20-Year War:**
- Detection systems evolve constantly
- Player reports are valuable
- Economic impact justifies aggressive action
- Perfect solution doesn't exist

**BlueMarble Strategy:**
- Build detection from day one
- Monitor economic anomalies
- Act quickly on bot patterns
- Accept imperfect victory
