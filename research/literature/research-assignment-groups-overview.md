## Priority Distribution Across All Groups

| Priority | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 2 | 7% |
| High | 14 | 50% |
| Medium | 7 | 25% |
| Low | 4 | 14% |
| Very Low | 1 | 4% |

**Total:** 28 topics

## Workload Balance

Each group has been balanced to ensure:
- **Similar Total Effort:** 30-50 hours per group
- **Priority Mix:** Each group has at least 1 Critical or 3+ High priority items
- **Diverse Content:** Mix of technical, design, and content research
- **Manageable Scope:** 6-7 topics per group

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Items (Week 1)
All groups should prioritize Critical items first:
- Group 1: Network Programming for Games
- Group 2: Multiplayer Game Programming

### Phase 2: High Priority Items (Weeks 1-2)
Focus on High priority items while Critical items are being reviewed:
- Groups 1 & 2: Technical high-priority items
- Groups 3 & 4: Design and content high-priority items

### Phase 3: Medium & Low Priority Items (Weeks 2-3)
Complete remaining items and cross-review:
- All groups: Complete Medium priority items
- Time permitting: Low and Very Low priority items

### Phase 4: Review & Integration (Week 3)
- Cross-group review of completed research
- Integration planning
- Documentation updates

## Assignment Workflow

### For Assignees

1. **Review Assignment Group:** Read your assigned group document thoroughly
2. **Start with Critical/High:** Begin with highest priority items
3. **Follow Research Process:** Use the 30-40-30 split (Review-Analysis-Documentation)
4. **Document as You Go:** Create analysis documents following established formats
5. **Update Progress:** Check off completed items in your group checklist
6. **Submit Work:** Place documents in `research/literature/` directory

### For Coordinators

1. **Assign Groups:** Assign one group per team member
2. **Monitor Progress:** Check weekly on completion rates
3. **Support Research:** Provide clarification and resources as needed
4. **Review Outputs:** Quality check completed documents
5. **Update Master Queue:** Mark topics complete in master research queue

## Quality Standards

All research outputs must meet these standards:

### Document Requirements
- ‚úÖ Proper YAML front matter
- ‚úÖ Minimum length as specified per topic
- ‚úÖ Code examples where relevant
- ‚úÖ Cross-references to related research
- ‚úÖ Clear recommendations for BlueMarble

### File Naming
- ‚úÖ Use kebab-case: `game-dev-analysis-[topic].md`
- ‚úÖ Consistent prefixes: `game-dev-analysis-` or `survival-content-extraction-`
- ‚úÖ Descriptive names matching topic

### Content Quality
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive coverage of topic
- ‚úÖ Analysis relevant to BlueMarble project
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Proper citations and references

## Communication Channels

### Questions and Clarifications
- Review existing completed documents for examples
- Check `research/literature/README.md` for guidelines
- Consult `research/literature/example-topic.md` for template
- Reference master research queue for broader context

### Collaboration
- Groups can coordinate on overlapping topics
- Cross-review encouraged for quality assurance
- Share insights that benefit multiple groups

## Success Metrics

### Completion Targets
- **Week 1:** All Critical items complete (2 topics)
- **Week 2:** 50% of High priority items complete (7 topics)
- **Week 3:** 80% of all items complete (22+ topics)

### Quality Targets
- 100% documents meet minimum length requirements
- 100% documents have proper front matter
- 100% documents include BlueMarble-specific recommendations
- 90%+ documents include code examples or practical guidance

## File Locations

### Assignment Group Documents
- `/research/literature/research-assignment-group-1.md`
- `/research/literature/research-assignment-group-2.md`
- `/research/literature/research-assignment-group-3.md`
- `/research/literature/research-assignment-group-4.md`

### Output Location
- All completed research documents: `/research/literature/`
- Naming pattern: `game-dev-analysis-[topic].md` or `survival-content-extraction-[topic].md`

### Master Tracking
- Master queue: `/research/literature/master-research-queue.md`
- Update after each completion

## Next Steps

1. **Assign groups to team members** (4 assignees needed)
2. **Kick-off meeting** to review process and answer questions
3. **Begin Phase 1** with Critical priority items
4. **Weekly check-ins** to track progress and provide support
5. **Final review** and master queue update upon completion
