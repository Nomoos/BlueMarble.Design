## Combined Priority Distribution (All 40 Groups)

| Priority | Original (1-20) | Online (21-40) | Total | Percentage |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 2 | 9 | 11 | 16% |
| High | 14 | 22 | 36 | 53% |

| Reserved | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1% |
| **Total** | **28** | **40** | **68** | **100%** |

## Workload Balance

Groups are balanced for completion time:

- **1 week completion:** Groups 16-20 (light workload - original queue)
- **1-2 weeks completion:** Groups 11-15, 36-40 (medium workload)
- **2 weeks completion:** Groups 1-10, 21-35 (full workload - includes Critical sources)

All 40 groups can work in parallel without blocking each other.

---

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Start (Week 1)

**Critical Groups (1-2):**
- Start immediately
- Highest priority for MMORPG architecture
- Block out dedicated time

**High Priority Groups (3-9):**
- Start Day 1
- Core systems and design
- Complete within 2 weeks

**Medium Priority Groups (10-15):**
- Start Day 1-3
- Enhancement and optimization
- Complete within 1-2 weeks

**Low Priority Groups (16-19):**
- Start Day 3-5
- Specialized/future content
- Complete within 1 week

**Reserve Group (20):**
- On standby
- Activate only when discoveries are made
- Flexible timeline

### Phase 2: Source Discovery Integration

After initial groups complete:
1. Review discovered sources from all 40 groups
2. Create new assignment groups (Phase 2 groups)
3. Use `research-assignment-template-phase-2.md` template
4. Continue parallel execution model

---

## Source Discovery Process

### During Research

As demonstrated in previous research phases (e.g., analyzing "Game Programming in C++" discovered 5 additional sources), new relevant sources will be identified during analysis.

### Discovery Tracking

Each assignment group file includes a **"New Sources Discovery"** section where assignees should log:

1. **Source Name** - Full title of discovered source
2. **Discovered From** - Which topic led to this discovery
3. **Priority** - Assignee's assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Category** - Type of source (GameDev-Tech, GameDev-Design, Survival, etc.)
5. **Rationale** - Why this source is relevant to BlueMarble
6. **Estimated Effort** - Hours needed for future analysis

### Discovery Examples

**Historical Pattern:**
- Analyzing "Game Programming in C++" discovered:
  - Game Engine Architecture (High priority)
  - Real-Time Rendering (High priority)
  - Network Programming for Games (Critical priority)
  - Multiplayer Game Programming (Critical priority)
  - Modern C++ Best Practices (Medium priority)

**Expected Pattern:**
- Analyzing technical books → discover advanced specialized topics
- Analyzing design books → discover psychology/motivation research
- Analyzing survival collections → discover specialized subcollections
- Analyzing architecture → discover specific implementation guides

### Reserve Group 20 for Immediate Discoveries

Unlike Phase 2 planning, **Group 20** provides immediate capacity:

1. **Discovery Made:** Assignee discovers critical source
2. **Log in Group File:** Document in discovery section
3. **Escalate if Critical:** Notify coordinator
4. **Assign to Group 20:** Move high-priority discovery immediately
5. **Continue Work:** Don't wait for Phase 2 planning

This ensures critical discoveries can begin research immediately without blocking progress.

### Source Redistribution (Phase 2)

After Phase 1 completion:

1. **Collect Discoveries** - Gather all newly discovered sources from all 20 groups
2. **Prioritize** - Review and validate priority assessments
3. **Balance** - Create new Phase 2 assignment groups (another 20 if needed)
4. **Assign** - Distribute to team members for next research cycle

This iterative process ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining parallel execution efficiency.

## Assignment Workflow

### For Assignees

1. **Review Assignment Group:** Read your assigned group document (group-01 through group-20)
2. **Start with Highest Priority:** Begin with Critical/High priority items
3. **Follow Research Process:** Use the 30-40-30 split (Review-Analysis-Documentation)
4. **Document as You Go:** Create analysis documents following established formats
5. **Log Discoveries:** Add newly found sources to discovery section
6. **Update Progress:** Check off completed items in your group checklist
7. **Submit Work:** Place documents in `research/literature/` directory

### For Coordinators

1. **Assign Groups:** Assign one group per team member (20 assignees)
2. **Monitor Progress:** Daily/weekly check-ins on completion
3. **Support Research:** Provide clarification and resources as needed
4. **Review Outputs:** Quality check completed documents
5. **Manage Group 20:** Assign critical discoveries immediately
6. **Update Master Queue:** Mark topics complete in master research queue
7. **Plan Phase 2:** Collect discoveries for next iteration

## Communication and Coordination

### Minimizing Merge Conflicts

With 20 parallel groups:
- Each person works on 1-2 topics maximum
- Output files are unique per group
- No shared files except discovery logging
- Coordinators handle master queue updates centrally

### Collaboration Opportunities

- Cross-reference related topics across groups
- Share insights in team channels
- Coordinate on overlapping categories
- Peer review available documents

### Support Channels

- Review existing completed documents for examples
- Check `research/literature/README.md` for guidelines
- Consult `research/literature/example-topic.md` for template
- Reference master research queue for broader context

## Success Metrics

### Completion Targets

With 40 parallel workers:

- **Day 3:** All Critical items complete (4 topics, Groups 1-4)
- **Week 1:** 50% of High priority items complete (14+ topics, Groups 5-18)
- **Week 2:** 80% of all items complete (44+ topics, Groups 1-36)
- **Week 2:** Groups 37-40 activated if discoveries warrant immediate attention

### Quality Targets

- 100% documents meet minimum length requirements
- 100% documents have proper front matter
- 100% documents include BlueMarble-specific recommendations
- 90%+ documents include code examples or practical guidance
- Each group logs at least 1 discovered source

---

## Next Steps

1. **Assign groups to 20 team members** (1 group per person)
2. **Kick-off meeting** to review process and answer questions
3. **Begin Phase 1** with all groups starting in parallel
4. **Daily standups** first week for coordination
5. **Weekly check-ins** for progress tracking
6. **Final review** and master queue update upon completion
7. **Phase 2 Planning** - After Phase 1, use discovered sources to create Phase 2 assignments

### Phase 2+ Planning

When Phase 1 completes:
1. Review "New Sources Discovery" sections in all 20 group files
2. Use template: `/research/literature/research-assignment-template-phase-2.md`
3. Create balanced Phase 2 assignment groups (up to 20 new groups if needed)
4. Update master research queue with all new sources
5. Continue iterative research process with same parallel model
