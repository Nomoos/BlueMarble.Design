## Source Summaries

### Source 1: Game Theory in MMORPG Economies

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 3-4h

Game theory analysis of player behavior in MMORPG economies. Cooperation vs. competition in resource gathering and trading.

**Key Topics:** Game theory, cooperation dynamics, resource hoarding, market manipulation, trust systems

**BlueMarble Application:** Player behavior prediction, anti-manipulation safeguards, cooperation incentives

---

### Source 2: Procedural Generation for Economies

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 5-7h

Using PCG for creating economic content (resource nodes, loot tables, recipes). Relevant for planet-scale economy.

**Key Topics:** PCG resource distribution, procedural loot, dynamic recipes, economic balance, quality vs quantity

**BlueMarble Application:** Procedural resource placement, dynamic content, planet-scale generation

---

### Source 3: Unity DOTS for Economic Simulation

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 4-6h

Specific patterns for using DOTS/ECS to simulate large-scale economic agents (traders, merchants, gatherers) at high performance.

**Key Topics:** ECS economic agents, batch transactions, job system, market calculation, agent AI performance

**BlueMarble Application:** Economic agent simulation, large-scale markets, NPC trader optimization

---

### Source 4: Spatial Databases for Resource Management

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 5-7h

Technical approaches for managing planetary-scale resource nodes, spatial queries, and efficient distribution tracking.

**Key Topics:** Spatial indexing, R-tree/quadtree optimization, geospatial queries, resource clustering, zone management

**BlueMarble Application:** Planetary resource management, spatial queries, octree integration, discovery optimization

---

### Source 5: Economic Telemetry and Analytics

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 4-6h

Technical and design approaches for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing economic data in MMORPGs.

**Key Topics:** Economic KPI design, real-time analytics, data visualization, anomaly detection, player behavior analytics

**BlueMarble Application:** Economic monitoring dashboard, real-time analytics, anomaly detection, health visualization
