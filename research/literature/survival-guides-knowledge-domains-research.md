## Tools and Automation

### Extraction Pipeline

**Step 1: Document Processing**
```python
import PyPDF2
import re
import json

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    """Extract raw text from PDF files"""
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page in reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

def identify_recipes(text):
    """Pattern matching for recipe-like content"""
    # Look for materials lists
    materials_pattern = r"Materials?:\s*(.*?)(?=\n\n|Process:|Steps:)"
    # Look for step-by-step instructions
    steps_pattern = r"(?:Steps?|Process|Procedure):\s*((?:\d+\..*?\n)+)"
    
    materials = re.findall(materials_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    steps = re.findall(steps_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    
    return {"materials": materials, "steps": steps}
```

**Step 2: Content Structuring**
```python
class RecipeExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recipes = []
        self.next_id = 1
    
    def extract_recipe(self, text, source_info):
        """Convert raw text to structured recipe"""
        content = identify_recipes(text)
        
        recipe = {
            "recipe_id": f"extracted_{self.next_id:04d}",
            "raw_materials": content["materials"],
            "raw_steps": content["steps"],
            "source": source_info,
            "extraction_date": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "review_status": "needs_review"
        }
        
        self.recipes.append(recipe)
        self.next_id += 1
        return recipe
    
    def export_for_review(self, filename):
        """Export extracted content for manual review"""
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:

    return {
        "recipe_id": generate_game_id(reviewed_recipe),
        "name": reviewed_recipe["name"],
        "tier": reviewed_recipe["assigned_tier"],
        "category": reviewed_recipe["category"],
        "inputs": parse_materials(reviewed_recipe["materials"]),
        "outputs": parse_outputs(reviewed_recipe["outputs"]),
        "requirements": {
            "skill": reviewed_recipe["skill_requirement"],
            "skill_level": reviewed_recipe["skill_level"],
            "workshop": reviewed_recipe["workshop"],
            "time_minutes": reviewed_recipe["time"]
