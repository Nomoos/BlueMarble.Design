The analysis identifies key knowledge domains relevant to BlueMarble's game design, particularly for crafting, 
skill progression, and player education systems.

**Key Findings:**
- Survival knowledge encompasses 12+ distinct domains forming a dependency hierarchy
- Knowledge preservation and transmission are core survival themes (maps to skill learning mechanics)
- Resource categories naturally cluster into tiers: primitive → agricultural → industrial → technological
- Communication and collaboration tools are essential even in survival scenarios
- Real-world survival skills provide authentic basis for crafting recipes and skill trees
- Medical knowledge, food preservation, and shelter construction form foundational skill categories

**Relevance to BlueMarble:**
The survival guides repository provides a reality-grounded foundation for designing authentic crafting systems,
skill progression trees, and knowledge discovery mechanics. The hierarchical nature of survival skills maps 
naturally to BlueMarble's progressive complexity in material processing and crafting systems.
