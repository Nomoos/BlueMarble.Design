    "irrigation_area": "0.5_hectares",
    "manual_labor_savings": "50_percent",
    "energy_cost": "human_power"
  }
}
```

### Category 4: Community Systems (Tier 2-5) - Various

**Social Infrastructure:**
- Education systems (schools, apprenticeships)
- Healthcare clinics
- Market systems
- Governance structures
- Cooperative organizations

**Game Integration:**
```python
class CommunitySystem:
    def __init__(self, settlement):
        self.settlement = settlement
        self.systems = []
    
    def add_education_system(self, tier):
        """Add education system to settlement"""
        if tier == 2:
            # Basic education
            system = {
                "type": "apprenticeship",
                "students": 10,
                "skill_transfer_rate": 0.5,
                "cost_per_day": {"food": 20, "time": 4}
            }
        elif tier == 3:
            # Formal school
            system = {
                "type": "village_school",
                "students": 50,
                "teachers": 2,
                "subjects": ["literacy", "numeracy", "basic_science"],
                "skill_boost": 1.2
            }
        
        self.systems.append(system)
        return system
    
    def calculate_prosperity(self):
        """Calculate settlement prosperity based on systems"""
        base_prosperity = self.settlement.population * 10
        
        # Bonus from systems
        education_bonus = len([s for s in self.systems if s["type"] in ["apprenticeship", "village_school"]]) * 50
        health_bonus = len([s for s in self.systems if s["type"] == "clinic"]) * 30
        market_bonus = len([s for s in self.systems if s["type"] == "market"]) * 40
        
        return base_prosperity + education_bonus + health_bonus + market_bonus
```

## Cross-Collection Integration

### Avoiding Duplication

**CD3WD as Supplement:**
- Primary extraction from specialized collections
- CD3WD fills specific gaps
- CD3WD provides alternative perspectives
- CD3WD offers community-scale implementations

**Gap Areas CD3WD Fills:**
1. Community organization mechanics
2. Settlement planning systems
3. Economic systems (markets, trade)
4. Education and skill transfer
5. Cooperative farming techniques

## Extraction Methodology

### Step 1: Content Survey (Week 1)

**Identify Unique Content:**
```python
def survey_cd3wd_content():
    """Survey CD3WD to find unique contributions"""
    
    cd3wd_topics = extract_all_topics("cd3wd_collection")
    existing_topics = load_existing_extractions()
    
    unique_topics = []
    for topic in cd3wd_topics:
        if not in_existing(topic, existing_topics):
            unique_topics.append({
                "topic": topic,
                "priority": rate_priority(topic),
                "integration_path": suggest_integration(topic)
            })
    
    return sorted(unique_topics, key=lambda x: x["priority"], reverse=True)
```

### Step 2: Targeted Extraction (Week 2-4)

**Focus on High-Value Unique Content:**
1. Infrastructure planning systems
2. Community organization mechanics
3. Settlement-scale implementations
4. Alternative technology approaches

### Step 3: Integration Planning (Week 4)

**Map to Game Systems:**
- Settlement management system
- Faction mechanics
- Economic simulation
- Education/skill transfer

## Deliverables

1. **unique_content_list.json** - CD3WD-specific contributions
2. **recipes_infrastructure_tier3-4.json** - Infrastructure systems
3. **mechanics_community.json** - Community organization systems
4. **recipes_appropriate_tech_supplement.json** - Additional technologies
5. **integration_guide_settlement.md** - Settlement system integration

## Success Metrics

- **Unique Content:** 100+ unique contributions identified
- **No Duplication:** Avoid repeating other collection content
- **Community Focus:** Strong community-scale mechanics
- **Integration:** Seamlessly extends existing systems

## Next Steps

1. Download CD3WD collection from Archive.org
2. Survey content for unique contributions
3. Compare against all other extracted content
4. Extract high-priority unique content
5. Integrate with settlement/faction systems
