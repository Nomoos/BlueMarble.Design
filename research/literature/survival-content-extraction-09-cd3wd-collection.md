    existing_topics = load_existing_extractions()
    
    unique_topics = []
    for topic in cd3wd_topics:
        if not in_existing(topic, existing_topics):
            unique_topics.append({
                "topic": topic,
                "priority": rate_priority(topic),
                "integration_path": suggest_integration(topic)
            })
    
    return sorted(unique_topics, key=lambda x: x["priority"], reverse=True)
```

### Step 2: Targeted Extraction (Week 2-4)

**Focus on High-Value Unique Content:**
1. Infrastructure planning systems
