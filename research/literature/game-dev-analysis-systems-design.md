## Core Concepts

### 1. The Core Game Loop

The core game loop is the fundamental cycle of player actions that drives engagement and creates the primary gameplay experience.

#### Loop Structure

**Basic Loop Pattern:**
```
Action → Feedback → Reward → Motivation → Action (repeat)
```

**Layered Loop Design:**

Game loops typically exist at multiple time scales:

**Micro Loop (Seconds to Minutes):**
- Immediate player actions (move, gather, craft)
- Instant feedback (visual/audio confirmation)
- Small rewards (resources collected, progress made)
- Rapid iteration encourages experimentation

**Meso Loop (10-60 Minutes):**
- Session-level goals (complete a structure, explore an area)
- Medium-term progression (skill improvements, tool upgrades)
- Substantial rewards (new capabilities unlocked)
- Maintains engagement within a play session

**Macro Loop (Hours to Days/Weeks):**
- Long-term objectives (major construction projects, technology advancement)
- Character/world development (significant progression milestones)
- Major rewards (game-changing abilities, new regions)
- Provides direction and long-term goals

#### Application to Survival Games

Successful survival games integrate these loops seamlessly:

**Example: Immediate Loop (2-5 minutes)**
- Player is hungry → searches for food → gathers berries → eats → hunger satisfied → continues exploring
- Risk: encounter predator → flee/fight → survive → gain experience → stronger

**Example: Session Loop (30-60 minutes)**
- Need better tools → gather wood and stone → craft workbench → craft tools → more efficient gathering
- Explore new area → discover resources → establish outpost → enable long-distance operations

**Example: Long-term Loop (multiple sessions)**
- Winter approaching → need shelter and food stores → build structures → stockpile resources → survive winter → unlock new season
- Basic survival established → research technology → advanced crafting → new gameplay possibilities

#### Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Players should understand what actions to take next
2. **Pacing**: Vary loop lengths to maintain interest
3. **Interconnection**: Loops should feed into each other
4. **Escalation**: Each iteration should increase in stakes or complexity
5. **Choice**: Players should have multiple loop paths available

### 2. System Interaction Patterns

Game systems should not exist in isolation but interact to create emergent gameplay.

#### System Design Philosophy

**Modular Architecture:**
```
System A (Health) ←→ System B (Hunger)
     ↑                      ↓
     └──── System C (Environment) ────┘
```

Each system:
- Has clear inputs and outputs
- Operates on consistent rules
- Can function independently
- Produces meaningful interactions when combined

#### Interaction Types

**1. Direct Interactions**
- One system directly modifies another's state
- Example: Hunger system reduces health over time
- Clear causality, easy for players to understand

**2. Mediated Interactions**
- Systems affect each other through intermediate mechanics
- Example: Temperature affects stamina consumption, which affects movement speed
- Creates depth without overwhelming complexity

**3. Emergent Interactions**
- Unplanned but meaningful combinations
- Example: Fire system + weather system + vegetation system = dynamic forest fires
- Source of novelty and discovery

#### Design Patterns for BlueMarble

**Resource Flow Systems:**
```
Gathering → Inventory → Crafting → Equipment → Enhanced Gathering
```

**Environmental Interaction:**
```
Geology ←→ Weather ←→ Vegetation ←→ Wildlife ←→ Player Actions
```

**Social/Economic Systems:**
```
Player Production → Trading → Market Prices → Production Incentives
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Define what each system controls
2. **Documented Interfaces**: Specify how systems communicate
3. **Fail-Safe Design**: System failures shouldn't cascade catastrophically
4. **Tunable Parameters**: Allow balancing without system redesign
5. **Observable State**: Players should understand system interactions

### 3. Progression Frameworks

Progression systems give players a sense of growth and mastery over time.

#### Progression Dimensions

**1. Vertical Progression (Power)**
- Character becomes stronger/more capable
- Examples: skill levels, stat increases, better equipment
- Provides clear sense of advancement
- Risk: can make early content trivial

**2. Horizontal Progression (Options)**
- Player gains new capabilities without pure power increase
- Examples: new crafting recipes, exploration areas, playstyles
- Maintains challenge while expanding gameplay
- Encourages experimentation and specialization

**3. Narrative Progression**
- Story advancement, lore discovery
- Provides context and meaning to actions
- Motivates exploration and goal completion

**4. Social Progression**
- Reputation, relationships, community standing
- Enables multiplayer engagement
- Creates social goals beyond mechanical systems

#### Progression Curves

**Linear Progression:**
```
Effort → Reward relationship is constant
Time 1 → Reward 1
Time 2 → Reward 2
Time 3 → Reward 3
```
- Predictable, easy to understand
- Can feel grindy long-term

**Exponential Progression:**
```
Each level requires more effort than previous
Level 1: 100 XP
Level 2: 150 XP
Level 3: 225 XP
Level 4: 337 XP
```
- Common in RPGs
- Early game feels fast, late game slows
- Risk: excessive grind at high levels

**Logarithmic Progression:**
```
Early gains require little effort, later gains diminishing
Hour 1: +50% efficiency
Hour 10: +70% efficiency
Hour 100: +85% efficiency
```
- Fast early progression hooks players
- Prevents runaway power scaling
- Maintains challenge throughout

**Milestone-Based Progression:**
```
Major improvements at specific milestones
Bronze Age → Iron Age → Steel Age
```
- Clear sense of achievement
- Punctuates long-term play
- Enables game phase transitions

#### Progression in Survival Games

Effective survival game progression:

**Early Game (Hours 1-10):**
- Rapid basic skill acquisition
- Simple tool and shelter progression
- Exploration of nearby area
- Learning core mechanics

**Mid Game (Hours 10-50):**

- Trading and Economics

### 4. Feedback Systems

Feedback systems communicate game state and consequences of player actions.

#### Feedback Types

**1. Visual Feedback**
- UI indicators (health bars, resource counts)
- World state visualization (damage effects, resource depletion)
- Character animation (fatigue, carrying heavy loads)
- Environmental cues (weather changes, day/night)

**2. Audio Feedback**
- Action confirmation (sound effects for gathering, crafting)
- Warning signals (danger approaching, critical status)
- Ambient soundscapes (location-specific audio)
- Musical cues (combat, discovery, achievement)

**3. Haptic Feedback**
- Controller vibration (impacts, machinery operation)
- Intensity variation (light touch vs heavy impact)
- Pattern-based communication (different events have distinct feel)

**4. Textual Feedback**
- System messages (gained items, leveled up)
- Tutorial hints (contextual guidance)
- Lore and narrative (books, signs, dialogue)
- Statistics and reports (detailed information)

#### Feedback Principles

**Immediacy:**
- Feedback should occur within 100ms of action
- Delayed feedback breaks action-consequence link
- Predictive feedback (anticipating results) enhances responsiveness

**Clarity:**
- Unambiguous communication of what happened
- Consistent feedback for similar events
- Appropriate detail level (not overwhelming)

**Proportionality:**
- Feedback intensity matches event significance
- Major events get major feedback
- Common events have subtle feedback

**Multimodal:**
- Combine multiple feedback types for important events
- Redundancy ensures message received
- Different modalities serve different purposes

#### Feedback in Complex Systems

For BlueMarble's geological systems:

**Resource Quality Feedback:**
```
Visual: Ore vein appearance, sparkle effects
Audio: Distinct mining sounds per material
Textual: Quality rating, purity percentage
UI: Color-coded inventory icons
```

**Environmental Hazard Feedback:**
```
Visual: Visual distortion, screen shake, warning icons
Audio: Rumbling, cracking sounds, alarm tones
Haptic: Increasing vibration intensity
Textual: "Earthquake warning", "Unstable ground"
```

**Progression Feedback:**
```
Visual: Level-up animation, skill unlock highlight
Audio: Achievement sound, fanfare
Textual: "New skill unlocked", detailed explanation
UI: Updated skill tree display
```

#### Balancing Information and Immersion

**Diegetic Feedback:**
- Exists within game world (character voice, environmental signs)
- Enhances immersion
- May be less clear than UI elements

**Non-Diegetic Feedback:**
- UI overlays, menus, HUD elements
- Crystal clear communication
- Can break immersion if overused

**Meta Feedback:**
- Outside game world (achievement pop-ups, social features)
- Provides meta-game information
- Should be toggleable

### 5. Economy Design

Game economies manage resource flow, create scarcity, and drive player decision-making.

#### Economic Fundamentals

**Resource Types:**

**1. Consumable Resources**
- Used up when consumed (food, fuel)
- Creates constant demand
- Drives gathering/production loops

**2. Durable Resources**
- Last indefinitely (tools, structures)
- One-time investment
- May degrade over time to create replacement demand

**3. Currency Resources**
- Medium of exchange (coins, credits)
- Enables indirect trading
- Can be saved and accumulated

**4. Time Resources**
- Player time, crafting time, travel time
- Non-renewable, universal constraint
- Creates opportunity costs

#### Economic Systems

**Resource Sources (Faucets):**
- Gathering from environment
- NPC vendors/rewards
- System generation (respawning resources)
- Player production (crafting, farming)

**Resource Sinks (Drains):**
- Consumption (eating, fuel use)
- Degradation (item durability)
- Crafting costs
- Trading fees/taxes
- Death penalties

**Balanced Economy:**
```
Total Faucets ≈ Total Sinks (over time)
```

Too many faucets → inflation, trivialized costs
Too many sinks → frustrating scarcity, negative gameplay

#### Economic Patterns

**1. Vertical Integration**
```
Raw Material → Refined Material → Component → Final Product
    Player A  →     Player B    →  Player C  →   Player D
```
- Specialization opportunities
- Trading networks emerge
- Complex production chains

**2. Scarcity-Based Value**
```
Common Resource → Low value → Easy to obtain
Rare Resource → High value → Difficult to obtain
```
- Risk/reward balance
- Motivates exploration and challenge

**3. Utility-Based Value**
```
High Utility Resource → High demand → High value
Low Utility Resource → Low demand → Low value
```
- Even common resources valuable if useful
- Design must ensure all resources have purpose

**4. Time-Value Relationships**
```
Quick to produce → Lower value
Slow to produce → Higher value
```
- Rewards patience and planning
- Creates market niches

#### Survival Game Economies

**Resource Categories for BlueMarble:**

**Basic Survival:**
- Food, water, shelter materials
- High consumption rate
- Must be abundant enough not to frustrate
- Creates baseline activity loop

**Construction Materials:**
- Wood, stone, metals
- Moderate consumption rate
- Should require exploration but not excessive grind
- Enables player creativity

**Advanced Materials:**
- Rare minerals, refined resources
- Low consumption rate
- Significant effort to obtain
- Gates late-game content

**Knowledge/Technology:**
- Research points, blueprints, discoveries
- Non-tradeable (or limited trading)
- Progression currency
- Rewards exploration and experimentation

#### Economic Balance Tools

**Dynamic Pricing:**
- Prices adjust based on supply/demand
- Prevents market manipulation
- Encourages diverse activities

**Resource Respawn Rates:**
- Control faucet flow
- Prevent resource exhaustion
- Balance across player count

**Crafting Costs:**
- Primary resource sink
- Should feel fair but substantial
- Recipes create resource demand

**Travel Costs:**
- Time and resources spent traveling
- Affects market integration
- Encourages local production vs trade
