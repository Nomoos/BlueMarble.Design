## Economic System Design Summary

### Currency System

**Primary Currency:**
- Trade Coins (TC) - Global currency
- Usage: Player-to-player trading, market transactions
- Acquisition: Quests, bounties, crafting sales
- Removal: Market fees, upkeep, repairs

**Regional Currencies:**
- North American Credits (NAC)
- European Marks (EUR)
- Asian Tokens (AST)
- Purpose: Regional specialization, trade incentives
- Exchange rates tied to Trade Coins

**Specialty Currencies:**
- Geological Survey Points (GSP) - Non-tradeable, survey unlocks
- Survival Tokens (ST) - Non-tradeable, skill upgrades

### Economic Balance Targets

**Source/Sink Ratio:** 1.0 to 1.1 (slightly inflationary)
- Allows for growth and new player onboarding
- Prevents deflation and hoarding
- EVE runs at ~1.15 (85.3T inflow vs 50.5T outflow)

**Monthly Destruction Rate:** 25-35% of production
- EVE: ~30-40% destruction rate
- BlueMarble target: 25-35% for balance
- Primary sink: Full-loot PvP (60-70% of destruction)

**Inflation Target:** 2-5% annually
- Healthy growth rate
- Prevents hyperinflation
- Maintains value of veteran player wealth

### Economic Metrics Dashboard

**Real-Time Tracking:**
- Total currency in circulation
- Currency faucets by type (quests, bounties, etc.)
- Currency sinks by type (repairs, upkeep, fees)
- Net currency flow (faucets - sinks)
- Velocity of money (transaction frequency)

**Material Tracking:**
- Total materials gathered (by type)
- Total materials consumed (by type)
- Material destruction rates
- Top destroyed items (EVE killmail equivalent)
- Regional material availability

**Market Analytics:**
- Average prices by item type
- Price index (inflation indicator)
- Transaction volumes
- Regional price disparities
- Arbitrage opportunities

**Player Wealth:**
- Average player wealth
- Wealth distribution (Gini coefficient)
- Top 1% vs. bottom 50%

- Material sources and sinks taxonomy
- Currency system design
- Player-driven market mechanics
- Economic monitoring and metrics
- Balance and sustainability strategies

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Transparency** - Monthly public reports like EVE
2. **Monitoring** - Real-time tracking from day one
3. **Balance** - Maintain source/sink ratio 1.0-1.1
4. **Player-Driven** - Minimal NPC intervention
5. **Professional Support** - Consider economist consultant

**Total Research Value:** 4604 lines of analysis covering every aspect of virtual economy design, with code examples, real-world data, and implementation roadmaps.

**Next Group:** Group 42 (Economy Case Studies) - Builds on these foundations with additional real-world examples.
