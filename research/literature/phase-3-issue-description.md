# Phase 3 Research: Game Economy & Technical Deep Dives

## Overview

Phase 3 research expands BlueMarble's knowledge base into two critical areas:

1. **Game Economy Systems** (NEW) - Economic design, material sources/sinks, player-driven economies
2. **Technical Deep Dives** (From Phase 2) - 13 high-priority sources discovered during Phase 2

This phase bridges the technical foundation from Phase 2 with the economic and game design systems needed for a sustainable MMORPG.
