        // Check authorization
        if (!IsAuthorizedRequester())
            return RequisitionStatus.Denied;
        
        // Check availability at supply point
        if (!CheckStockAvailability(SupplyPoint, ItemClass, ItemName, Quantity))
            return RequisitionStatus.Backordered;
        
        // Process based on priority
        int processingTime = CalculateProcessingTime(RequestPriority, Quantity);
        
        // Schedule transportation
        TransportOrder order = CreateTransportOrder(this);

    public List<TransportAsset> AvailableAssets { get; set; }
    
    public TransportPlan CreateLogisticsChain(SupplyPoint origin, SupplyPoint destination, List<Supply> cargo)

        // Calculate consumption rates
        Dictionary<string, int> required = CalculateConsumption(unitId, playerCount, daysSupply);
        
        // Check inventory against requirements
        foreach (var item in required)

    {
        int totalVolume = incomingSupplies.Sum(s => s.Volume);
        
        if (GetCurrentStorageUsed() + totalVolume > StorageCapacity)
        {
            // Trigger overflow procedures
            HandleStorageOverflow(incomingSupplies);
        }
        
        // Add to inventory
        foreach (var supply in incomingSupplies)
        {
            if (Inventory.ContainsKey(supply.ItemId))
                Inventory[supply.ItemId] += supply.Quantity;
            else
                Inventory[supply.ItemId] = supply.Quantity;

## Extraction Methodology

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Document Selection and Download
```python
import requests
import os

# List of priority field manuals
priority_manuals = [
    {"id": "FM 4-0", "title": "Sustainment Operations", "url": "..."},
    {"id": "FM 3-90", "title": "Offense and Defense", "url": "..."},
    {"id": "FM 3-34", "title": "Engineer Operations", "url": "..."},
    # ... more manuals
]

def download_manual(manual):
    """Download military manual from public source"""
    response = requests.get(manual['url'])
    filename = f"pdfs/{manual['id'].replace(' ', '_')}.pdf"
    
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    
    print(f"Downloaded: {manual['title']}")

# Download all priority manuals
for manual in priority_manuals:
    download_manual(manual)
```

#### Step 2: Text Extraction
```python
import PyPDF2
import pdfplumber

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    """Extract text content from PDF"""
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        
        for page in reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    
    return text

def extract_tables_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    """Extract tables from PDF"""
    tables = []
    
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        for page in pdf.pages:
            page_tables = page.extract_tables()
            tables.extend(page_tables)
    
    return tables

# Example usage
fm_4_0_text = extract_text_from_pdf("pdfs/FM_4-0.pdf")
supply_tables = extract_tables_from_pdf("pdfs/FM_4-0.pdf")
```

### Step 3: Content Analysis

**Pattern Matching for Mechanics:**
```python
import re

def extract_supply_rates(text):
    """Extract supply consumption rates"""
    # Look for patterns like "X units per Y time"
    pattern = r"(\d+\.?\d*)\s*(\w+)\s+per\s+(\w+)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    return matches

def extract_organization(text):
    """Extract unit organization structures"""
    # Look for tables of organization
    pattern = r"(Squad|Platoon|Company|Battalion)\s*:\s*(\d+)\s*(personnel|soldiers)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
    return matches
```

### Step 4: JSON Conversion

#### Step 3: Content Analysis and Categorization
```python
import spacy
import re

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def identify_game_mechanics(text):
    """Identify content relevant to game mechanics"""
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    mechanics = {
        "systems": [],
        "procedures": [],
        "calculations": [],
        "requirements": []
    }
    
    # Look for procedural language
    for sent in doc.sents:
        if re.search(r'\b(shall|must|will|required)\b', sent.text, re.IGNORECASE):
            mechanics["procedures"].append(sent.text)
        
        if re.search(r'\b(calculate|determine|estimate)\b', sent.text, re.IGNORECASE):
            mechanics["calculations"].append(sent.text)
        
        if re.search(r'\b(system|process|method)\b', sent.text, re.IGNORECASE):
            mechanics["systems"].append(sent.text)
    
    return mechanics

# Analyze logistics manual
logistics_mechanics = identify_game_mechanics(fm_4_0_text)
```

#### Step 4: JSON Conversion
```python
import json

def convert_to_game_data(mechanics, category):
    """Convert extracted mechanics to game data format"""
    game_data = {
        "category": category,
        "mechanics": [],
        "metadata": {
            "source": "FM 4-0",
            "extraction_date": "2025-01-15",
            "game_tier": "3-5"
        }
    }
    
    for mechanic in mechanics:
        game_data["mechanics"].append({
            "name": extract_mechanic_name(mechanic),
            "description": mechanic,
            "requirements": extract_requirements(mechanic),
            "effects": extract_effects(mechanic)
        })
    
    return game_data

# Convert and save
logistics_data = convert_to_game_data(logistics_mechanics["systems"], "logistics")
with open("game_data_logistics.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(logistics_data, f, indent=2)
```
