#### The Three C's of Level Design

**1. Character**
- Player capabilities define level possibilities
- Movement abilities (walk, run, jump, climb)
- Combat abilities (melee, ranged, special attacks)
- Interaction abilities (gather, craft, build)

**For BlueMarble:**
```
Character Capabilities:
- Movement: Walk, run, climb terrain
- Gathering: Mine, quarry, harvest resources
- Crafting: Combine materials, refine ores
- Building: Construct shelters, refineries
- Survival: Manage health, hunger, temperature
```

**2. Camera**
- Camera perspective affects gameplay
- Top-down: Strategic overview, area awareness
- Third-person: Immersion, spatial navigation
- First-person: Precision, detailed interaction

**BlueMarble Camera Strategy:**
```
Top-Down Isometric:
- Advantage: See geological formations clearly
- Advantage: Strategic resource gathering
- Advantage: Area awareness for hazards
- Advantage: Easy to understand terrain layers

Camera Controls:
- Zoom: See detail vs overview
- Rotate: View terrain from different angles
- Pan: Navigate large geological zones
```

**3. Controls**
- Intuitive mapping to player expectations
- Consistent across game contexts
- Responsive and satisfying feedback
- Customizable for player preference

#### Level Design Structure

**The Hook:**
Opening moment that establishes tone and teaches core mechanics.

```
BlueMarble Hook Example:
- Player spawns in a temperate zone
- Simple goal: "Gather 10 wood to build basic tools"
- Teaches: Movement, resource identification, gathering
- Reward: Crafting unlocked, stone tools available
```

**The Presentation:**
Teaching mechanics through guided play, not exposition.

```
Show, Don't Tell:
- Visual cues: Sparkling resources attract attention
- Environmental guidance: Path layouts guide exploration
- Consequence teaching: Cold zone damages health (teaches shelter need)
- Reward reinforcement: Tool upgrade improves gathering speed
```

**The Challenge:**
Core gameplay loop with escalating difficulty.

```
Challenge Progression:
Level 1: Gather common resources (wood, stone)
Level 2: Mine basic ores (copper, tin) - requires stone tools
Level 3: Refine metals - requires furnace construction
Level 4: Advanced materials - requires exploration of dangerous zones
Level 5: Rare resources - requires mastery of survival systems
```

**The Revelation:**
New ability or area unlocks expanded gameplay.

```
Revelation Moments:
- First metal tools: Gather faster, access harder materials
- First furnace: Transform raw ores into usable metals
- First dangerous zone: High-risk, high-reward resources
- First geological event: Dynamic world changes gameplay
```

   - Avoidance: Move to stable ground, seek shelter
   - Damage: Structural, health, equipment

2. Volcanic Activity:
   - Warning: Increased heat, sulfur smell, visual cues
   - Danger: Lava flows, pyroclastic clouds
   - Avoidance: Evacuate area, use heat protection
   - Reward: Rare volcanic materials after event

3. Cave-ins:
   - Warning: Cracking sounds, falling pebbles
   - Danger: Roof collapse, blocked exits
   - Avoidance: Leave unstable areas, use supports
   - Consequence: Trapped, need escape mechanics

4. Weather Extremes:
   - Warning: Sky changes, temperature shift
   - Danger: Blizzards, heat waves, storms
   - Protection: Appropriate clothing, shelter
   - Effect: Reduced visibility, health drain
```

**Hazard "Combat" Loop:**
```
1. Detect (Perception skill)
   - See warning signs earlier
   - More time to react

2. Prepare (Equipment/Abilities)
   - Use protective gear
   - Activate defensive abilities

3. Engage or Evade (Player Choice)
   - Risk it for resources
   - Play it safe, retreat

4. Resolve (Outcome)
   - Success: Survive, gain resources
   - Failure: Damage, lost progress
   - Learn: Better prepared next time
```

**Resource vs Risk:**
```
High-Value Resources in Dangerous Areas:
- Volcanic zones: Rare metals, gemstones
