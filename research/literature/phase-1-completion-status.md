## Phase 2 Planning Blockers

### Critical Blockers

1. **Incomplete Phase 1 Topics**
   - Group 03: 1 topic remaining (Energy Systems Collection - 5-7 hours)
   - Group 06: 1 topic remaining (Fundamentals of Game Design - 6-8 hours)

2. **Source Aggregation Pending**
   - Cannot finalize discovered sources count until all groups complete
   - Need to validate and deduplicate discovered sources
   - Priority assessment requires complete dataset

3. **Distribution Planning Requires Complete Data**
   - Phase 2 group assignments depend on total discovered sources
   - Balancing workload requires knowing full scope
   - Cannot create Phase 2 assignment files without complete source list

---

## Prerequisites for Phase 2 Planning

Per `/scripts/generate-research-issues.py` and Phase 1 research notes, Phase 2 planning requires:

### Mandatory Prerequisites

- [ ] **All 40 Phase 1 groups complete** (Currently: 38/40)
  - [ ] Complete Group 03 (Energy Systems Collection)
  - [ ] Complete Group 06 (Fundamentals of Game Design OR Games, Design and Play)

- [ ] **Discovered sources logged in assignment files**
  - ‚è≥ In progress - partial logging complete
  - Need final validation after Groups 03, 06, 39 complete

- [ ] **Master research queue updated**
  - ‚è≥ Needs update after final groups complete

### Planning Steps (Cannot Start Until Prerequisites Met)

- [ ] Collect discoveries from all 40 Phase 1 groups
- [ ] Validate and prioritize sources
- [ ] Create discovery statistics
- [ ] Balance and distribute into Phase 2 groups
- [ ] Create Phase 2 assignment files
- [ ] Update master research queue
- [ ] Create Phase 2 sub-issues

## Estimated Timeline to Phase 2 Readiness

### Remaining Phase 1 Work

| Group | Topics Remaining | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| 03 | 1 (Energy Systems) | 5-7 hours | High |
| 06 | 1 (Fundamentals) | 6-8 hours | High |
| **Total** | **2 topics** | **11-15 hours** | **High** |

### Phase 2 Planning Work

Once prerequisites are met:
- Source aggregation and validation: 2-3 hours
- Priority assessment: 2-3 hours
- Distribution planning: 3-4 hours
- Assignment file creation: 4-6 hours
- **Total Phase 2 Planning:** 11-16 hours

### Total Estimated Time to Phase 2 Launch

**22-31 hours** (Phase 1 completion + Phase 2 planning)

With parallel execution:
- If 2 people work on remaining Phase 1 topics: **5-8 hours** (1 day)
- Phase 2 planning by 1 person: **2-3 days** (11-16 hours)
- **Total to Phase 2 launch:** **3-4 days** (with parallel work)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Complete Group 03** (Partial, High Priority, 5-7 hours)
   - One remaining topic: Energy Systems Collection
   - Topics: Solar, wind, hydro, biofuel, power distribution infrastructure
   - Quick win for team member familiar with survival content
   - Document: `survival-content-extraction-energy-systems.md`

2. **Complete Group 06** (Partial, High Priority, 6-8 hours)
   - One remaining topic: Fundamentals of Game Design
   - Topics: Genre conventions, Bartle taxonomy, core mechanics, difficulty balancing
   - Essential for BlueMarble design foundation
   - Document: `game-dev-analysis-fundamentals.md`

**Total Remaining:** Only 11-15 hours of work across 2 topics!

### Quality Assurance

Before declaring Phase 1 complete:
- [x] Validate 38 of 40 group assignment files show complete status
- [ ] Complete remaining 2 groups (03 and 06)
- [ ] Verify all discovered sources are logged properly
- [ ] Confirm all research documents meet quality standards
- [ ] Update master research queue with Phase 1 results
- [ ] Update assignment file statuses for Groups 03 and 06

### Phase 2 Preparation

While waiting for Phase 1 completion:
- [ ] Review Phase 2 template: `research-assignment-template-phase-2.md`
- [ ] Prepare aggregation scripts/tools for source collection
- [ ] Review previous discovered sources queue files for patterns
- [ ] Plan Phase 2 group structure (likely 40 groups again for consistency)

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 is 95% complete** with only 2 topics remaining across 2 groups. The research has produced substantial value:

- **38 of 40 groups fully completed** with comprehensive documentation
- **~48+ discovered sources** identified for Phase 2
- **Multiple completion summaries** demonstrating thorough work
- **Clear patterns** for Phase 2 planning established
- **Only 11-15 hours** of work remaining

**Phase 2 planning cannot proceed** until Groups 03 and 06 complete their remaining topics (Energy Systems and Fundamentals of Game Design). Once complete, Phase 2 planning can be executed efficiently using established templates and processes.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **AWAITING 2 FINAL TOPICS** (11-15 hours remaining)

---

**Document Status:** Active Assessment  
**Next Update:** When Phase 1 groups 03 or 06 complete  
**Phase 2 Planning Start Date:** TBD (only 2 topics remaining - 11-15 hours)
