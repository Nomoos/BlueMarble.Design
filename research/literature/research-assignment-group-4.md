### 7. Learning Blender (Duplicate - Replace with actual 7th topic)

**NOTE:** This appears to be a duplicate. The actual 7th topic should be determined from the master queue.

**Fallback Topic: Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping and Development**

If the 7th topic needs clarification, this group could focus on the 6 clear topics listed above, making it slightly lighter than other groups to balance overall workload.
