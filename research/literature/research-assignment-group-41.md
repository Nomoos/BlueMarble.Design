## Phase 3 Research Assignment Group 41

**Document Type:** Phase 3 Research Assignment  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Total Topics:** 3 sources  
**Estimated Effort:** 30-37 hours  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Processing:** 4-source batches (or complete all 3 in one batch)

## Overview

This assignment group focuses on critical foundational texts for MMORPG economy design, with emphasis on material sources (where resources come from) and material sinks (where resources go). These sources represent the highest priority economic research for BlueMarble's player-driven economy.

**Assignment Instructions:**

```text
Next pick max 4 sources original from the assignment group or discovered during processing your assignment group
and process them one by one, always save new sources from source for later process, after that write summary and
wait for comment next to process next source, if there is non write completed and summary into comments
```

**Sources (Total: 3):**

1. Designing Virtual Worlds by Richard Bartle (Critical, 12-15h)

## Source Details

### Source 1: Designing Virtual Worlds by Richard Bartle

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 12-15 hours

#### Source Information

**Title:** Designing Virtual Worlds  
**Author:** Richard Bartle  
**Publisher:** New Riders

**Discovered From:** Phase 3 Planning - Economy Focus

#### Rationale

Richard Bartle's seminal work on MMORPG design is the foundational text for virtual world economics. As one of the creators of the first MUD (Multi-User Dungeon), Bartle provides comprehensive coverage of economic systems, player motivations, and world persistence. His frameworks for material sources and sinks are directly applicable to BlueMarble's player-driven economy.

#### Key Topics to Cover

- Economic balance in virtual worlds
- Player-driven vs. NPC-driven economies
- Material sources: resource generation, crafting, loot systems

- Player types and economic behavior (Bartle taxonomy)
- Resource scarcity and abundance design
- Trading systems and player markets
- Economic incentive structures

#### BlueMarble Application

- Design framework for material sources (mining, foraging, crafting)
- Material sink taxonomy (degradation, consumption, territory costs)
- Economic balance principles for planet-scale resources
- Player-driven market system design
- Economic metrics for monitoring economy health
- Integration with survival mechanics (food, water, equipment)

#### Deliverable

Comprehensive analysis document (minimum 400-600 lines, target 1000+) covering:
- Executive summary of Bartle's economic frameworks
- Material sources taxonomy with BlueMarble examples
- Material sinks taxonomy with implementation strategies

**Discovered From:** Phase 3 Planning - Economy Focus

#### Rationale

EVE Online represents the most successful player-driven MMORPG economy in gaming history. Their monthly economic reports provide real-world data on material sources, material sinks, inflation, and player behavior. CCP employs actual economists to manage their virtual economy, making their insights invaluable for BlueMarble's economic design.

#### Key Topics to Cover

- Material sources in EVE: mining, production, exploration, loot
- Material sinks in EVE: ship destruction, module degradation, market fees
- Economic indicators and metrics (Money Supply, ISK velocity, destruction rates)
- Preventing hyperinflation through balanced sinks
- Player-driven market systems and price discovery
- Economic impacts of full-loot PvP
- Territory control and resource generation
- Production chains and material transformation
- Market manipulation and fraud prevention
- Economic data collection and analysis tools

#### BlueMarble Application

- Material source design patterns (planet resource nodes, creature drops)
- Material sink implementation (equipment degradation, consumables)
- Economic metrics dashboard for monitoring
- Full-loot PvP economic implications
- Territory-based resource generation systems
- Player market and trading post mechanics
- Production chain design for crafting
- Economic balance formulas and simulations

#### Deliverable

Comprehensive analysis document (minimum 400-600 lines, target 1000+) covering:
- Executive summary of EVE's economic model
- Material sources analysis with real data examples
- Material sinks analysis with destruction metrics
- Economic balance strategies and anti-inflation mechanics
- Player market design patterns
- Code examples for economic simulation
- Cross-references to Bartle and Virtual Economies sources
