title: Research Assignment Group 20 - Reserve Group
date: 2025-01-15
tags: [research-queue, assignment, parallel-work, reserve]
status: reserved
assignee: TBD
---

**Document Type:** Research Assignment (Reserve)  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Total Topics:** 1 (activated)  
**Status:** Active - Topic 20.1 in progress

## Overview

This is a reserve/buffer assignment group designed to accommodate:

1. **Discovered Sources**: New research sources identified during Phase 1 work
2. **Overflow Work**: Topics that need to be split or expanded
3. **High-Priority Discoveries**: Critical sources found that need immediate attention

## Purpose

As demonstrated in previous research phases, analyzing sources often reveals additional important resources. For example, analyzing "Game Programming in C++" discovered 5 new critical sources. This group provides immediate capacity for such discoveries without waiting for Phase 2 planning.

## Activation Triggers

This group should be activated when:

- A Critical priority source is discovered during Phase 1
- Multiple High priority sources are discovered requiring immediate attention
- An existing topic needs to be split into multiple focused analyses
- Emergency research needs arise during development

## Assignment Process

When activating this group:

1. **Document Discovery**: Log the discovered source(s) with full details
2. **Priority Assessment**: Validate priority level
3. **Quick Assignment**: Assign to available team member immediately
4. **Update Tracking**: Add to master research queue
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track alongside other groups
