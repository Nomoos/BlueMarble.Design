## Phase 3 Research Assignment Group 49

**Document Type:** Phase 3 Research Assignment (Extension)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Total Topics:** 8 sources  
**Estimated Effort:** 24-33 hours  
**Priority:** High  
**Processing:** 4-source batches

## Overview

This assignment group examines extreme economic models, unusual systems, and edge cases that provide lessons through both success and failure. These sources help identify economic pitfalls and explore unconventional approaches.

**Sources (Total: 8):**

1. Star Wars Galaxies: Economic Design Post-Mortem (Critical, 6-8h)
2. Rust Economic Systems: Decay, Raids, and Material Loops (High, 3-4h)
3. Warframe: Free-to-Play Economy and Material Respect (High, 4-5h)
4. Dual Universe: Voxel Building Economy and Material Costs (Medium, 3-4h)
5. Lost Ark: Daily/Weekly Economic Cadence Design (Medium, 2-3h)
6. Minecraft: Emergent Economy in Multiplayer Servers (Medium, 2-3h)
7. Valheim: Progression-Gated Resource Design (Medium, 2-3h)
8. Factorio: Production Chain Optimization and Material Flow (Medium, 3-4h)

**Total Estimated Effort:** 24-33 hours

## Source Summaries

### Source 1: Star Wars Galaxies - Economic Post-Mortem

**Priority:** Critical | **Effort:** 6-8h

SWG featured one of the most complex player-driven economies. Resource spawning, crafting quality, and complete interdependence. NGE provides crucial failure lessons.

**Key Topics:** Resource spawning, crafting quality, player interdependence, economic collapse, material distribution

**BlueMarble Application:** Resource node design, crafting quality systems, avoiding collapse scenarios

---

### Source 2: Rust - Aggressive Material Sinks

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 3-4h

Rust's aggressive sink design (decay, raids, full-loot) creates rapid material loops and high velocity.

**Key Topics:** Decay systems, raid economics, material velocity, base maintenance, wipe cycles

**BlueMarble Application:** Material sink patterns, decay implementation, economic velocity tuning

---

### Source 3: Warframe - Material Respect

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** 4-5h

Warframe balances F2P monetization with player-friendly material respect. Time sinks and platinum economy insights.

**Key Topics:** Time as sink, crafting time, premium currency, trading economy, material respect

**BlueMarble Application:** Time-based sinks, currency balance, player-friendly design

---

### Source 4: Dual Universe - Voxel Economy

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 3-4h

Voxel-based building creates material sink where construction costs correlate with complexity.

**Key Topics:** Voxel material costs, construction sinks, material volume, blueprint economics

**BlueMarble Application:** Voxel building costs, construction sinks, material volume tracking

---

### Source 5: Lost Ark - Economic Cadence

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 2-3h

Daily/weekly economic cadence creates predictable material flow patterns and player engagement.

**Key Topics:** Time-gated resources, material source cadence, weekly resets, engagement through economy

**BlueMarble Application:** Time-based generation, economic cadence, daily/weekly activities

---

### Source 6: Minecraft - Emergent Economy

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 2-3h

Emergent player-driven economies without explicit systems. Understanding minimal economic frameworks.

**Key Topics:** Emergent economy, player-created currencies, barter systems, community markets

**BlueMarble Application:** Emergent behaviors, minimal frameworks, player-driven value creation

---

### Source 7: Valheim - Progression-Gated Resources

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 2-3h

Progression system gates resources behind boss kills, creating clear material source unlocking.

**Key Topics:** Progression-gated resources, boss unlocks, biome-based tiers, building progression

**BlueMarble Application:** Progression-based unlocking, tiered materials, region-based progression

---

### Source 8: Factorio - Production Optimization

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 3-4h

Extreme production chain complexity. Throughput calculations and bottleneck analysis.

**Key Topics:** Production chains, material throughput, bottleneck analysis, consumption rates

**BlueMarble Application:** Complex production, material flow optimization, throughput calculations

---
