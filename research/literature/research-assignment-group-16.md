---

**Source Name:** Game Engine Architecture (4th Edition) by Jason Gregory  
**Discovered From:** Unity Game Development in 24 Hours analysis (Topic 16)  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Comprehensive reference for engine architecture patterns. Covers core systems (rendering, physics, AI, networking) applicable to both Unity and custom engine approaches. Essential for understanding trade-offs between using existing engines vs. building custom systems for BlueMarble.  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours for full analysis

**Source Name:** Real-Time Rendering (4th Edition) by Tomas Akenine-Möller et al.  
**Discovered From:** Unity Game Development in 24 Hours analysis (Topic 16)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Deep dive into rendering techniques for planet-scale terrain visualization. Covers LOD systems, culling algorithms, and shader techniques needed for geological simulation rendering. Relevant for optimizing BlueMarble's visual performance.  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours for relevant chapters

**Source Name:** Unreal Engine Documentation  
**Discovered From:** Unity Game Development in 24 Hours analysis (Topic 16)  
**Priority:** Medium
