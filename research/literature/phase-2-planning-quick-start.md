**Phase 2:** Cannot start until Phase 1 is 100% complete

---

## Step 1: Complete Remaining Phase 1 Work (11-15 hours)

### Group 03: Energy Systems Collection (5-7 hours)

3. Focus on MMORPG-relevant concepts
4. Create comprehensive analysis document
5. Update `research-assignment-group-06.md` progress tracking
6. Mark status as complete when done

---

## Step 2: Validate Phase 1 Completion

Once Groups 03 and 06 are complete:

```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/validate-phase1-completion.sh

# Should show:
# âœ… Completed: 40 (100%)
# ðŸŽ‰ Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE!
# âœ… Ready to proceed with Phase 2 Planning
```

---

## Step 3: Aggregate Discovered Sources (2-3 hours)

### Collect Sources from All Groups

**Method 1: Manual Collection**
1. Review all 40 `research-assignment-group-*.md` files
2. Look for "Discovered Sources" or "New Sources Discovery" sections
3. Extract source names, URLs, and priorities
4. Compile into master spreadsheet or document

**Method 2: Automated Collection** (recommended)
```bash
# Search all assignment files for discovered sources
for i in {01..40}; do
  echo "=== Group $i ==="
  grep -A 20 "Discovered Sources\|New Sources" \
    research/literature/research-assignment-group-${i}.md
done > /tmp/all-discovered-sources.txt
```

### Review Existing Queue Files

Check these files for already-tracked discoveries:
- `research/literature/discovered-sources-queue.md` (Group 36)
- `research/literature/research-assignment-group-22-discovered-sources-queue.md`
- `research/literature/assignment-group-35-discovered-sources-queue.md`

### Expected Output

Create a document listing:
- Total discovered sources count (estimated: 50-60)
- Sources by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Sources by category (GameDev-Tech, GameDev-Design, Survival, etc.)
- Duplicate detection and deduplication
- Initial estimates for Phase 2 effort

---

## Step 4: Prioritize and Categorize (2-3 hours)

### Priority Assessment

For each discovered source, determine:
- **Critical:** Foundational knowledge, immediate implementation need
- **High:** Core systems, important for MMORPG functionality
- **Medium:** Supporting systems, quality improvements
- **Low:** Nice-to-have, future enhancements

### Category Assignment

Group sources by:
- **GameDev-Tech:** Programming, networking, rendering, etc.
- **GameDev-Design:** Game design, mechanics, player psychology
- **GameDev-Art:** Graphics, VFX, audio, animation
- **Survival:** Survival knowledge for game content
- **Architecture:** System design, databases, distributed systems

### Effort Estimation

For each source:
- Quick analysis: 2-4 hours
- Standard analysis: 4-8 hours
- Deep analysis: 8-12 hours
- Comprehensive analysis: 12-16 hours

---

## Step 5: Create Phase 2 Distribution Plan (3-4 hours)

### Use Existing Structure

Phase 2 should maintain 40-group structure for consistency:
- Groups 1-20: Higher priority / complex sources
- Groups 21-40: Medium priority / balanced effort

### Balancing Algorithm

1. Calculate total estimated hours for all discovered sources
2. Divide by 40 to get average hours per group
3. Distribute sources to achieve 4-8 hours per group average
4. Keep related sources in same group when possible
5. Isolate each group's sources to prevent merge conflicts

### Document Format

Use template: `research/literature/research-assignment-template-phase-2.md`

Each Phase 2 group file should include:
- Group number and metadata
- Assigned sources (1-3 per group typically)
- Priority levels
- Estimated effort
- Clear deliverables
- Quality standards
- Progress tracking checklist

---

## Step 6: Create Phase 2 Assignment Files (4-6 hours)

### File Creation Process

For each of 40 groups:

1. **Create file:** `research-assignment-group-{01-40}-phase2.md`
2. **Add YAML front matter:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Research Assignment Group {N} - Phase 2
   date: 2025-01-XX
   tags: [research-queue, phase-2, assignment, parallel-work]
   status: pending
   assignee: TBD
   phase: 2
   ---
   ```
3. **Assign discovered sources** based on distribution plan
4. **Include all required sections:**
   - Overview
   - Topics (with source details)
   - Work guidelines
   - Quality standards
   - Progress tracking
   - Discovery logging

### Automation Option

Consider creating a script to generate files from distribution plan.

---

## Step 7: Update Master Research Queue (1-2 hours)

Update `research/literature/master-research-queue.md`:

1. Mark Phase 1 as complete
2. Add Phase 2 section
3. List all Phase 2 sources
4. Update completion statistics
5. Add Phase 2 timeline and milestones
6. Document Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 source lineage

---

## Step 8: Create Phase 2 Issues (2-3 hours)

Use `scripts/generate-research-issues.py` or similar:

1. Generate parent Phase 2 issue
2. Generate 40 individual group issues
3. Link child issues to parent
4. Add appropriate labels
5. Set initial assignees (if known)

---

## Total Time Estimate for Phase 2 Planning

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Aggregate discovered sources | 2-3 hours |
| Prioritize and categorize | 2-3 hours |
| Create distribution plan | 3-4 hours |
| Create assignment files | 4-6 hours |
| Update master queue | 1-2 hours |
| Create issues | 2-3 hours |
| **Total** | **14-21 hours** |

**With 2 people working:** 1-2 weeks  
**With dedicated effort:** 2-3 days
