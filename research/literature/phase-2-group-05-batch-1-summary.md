## Executive Summary

Batch 1 of Phase 2 Group 05 research focused on foundational survival systems: resource distribution, environmental cycles, construction techniques, and tool development. These four sources form the bedrock of BlueMarble's survival gameplay, establishing algorithmic approaches for procedural content, realistic environmental simulation, historically accurate building progression, and authentic technology trees.

The research demonstrates that successful survival systems balance three key concerns:
1. **Historical Authenticity** - Grounding mechanics in real-world principles
2. **Gameplay Progression** - Clear advancement paths that reward player skill
3. **Technical Performance** - Efficient algorithms for planet-scale simulation

Each source provides comprehensive implementation guidance with code examples, BlueMarble-specific recommendations, and phased roadmaps for development.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

**Resource Distribution:**
- Lazy generation: Only generate chunks near players
- Spatial indexing: Quadtrees for fast queries
- Caching: Store calculated positions for reuse
- Level-of-detail: Reduce resource density at distance

**Lighting System:**
- Update frequency: 0.1s intervals (10 FPS) sufficient
- Cached calculations: Store sun positions per hour
- Shader-based: GPU handles sky gradients
- Event-driven: Trigger gameplay changes at transitions only

**Building Calculations:**
- Client-side validation: Check placement before server call
- Async structure checks: Don't block while calculating stability
- Simplified physics: Use approximations, not full simulation
- Batch updates: Update multiple structures together

**Tool Durability:**
- Integer-based: Avoid floating-point precision issues
- Event-driven: Only update on use, not every frame
- Batched saves: Persist tool states periodically

### Data Structures

**Recommended:**
- Quadtrees for spatial resource indexing
- Hash maps for chunk-based lazy generation
- Priority queues for time-based events (day/night transitions)
- Skill trees as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Recipe unlocks as bitfields for fast checking

## Discovered Sources

During Batch 1 research, no additional high-priority sources were discovered. However, potential future research areas identified:

1. **Advanced Resource Processing** - Refining raw materials (ore processing, lumber milling)
2. **Furniture and Fixtures** - Interior building elements and functionality
3. **Defensive Structures** - Walls, gates, fortifications
4. **Advanced Metallurgy** - Alloy compositions, heat treatment, tool repair
5. **Traditional Crafts** - Leather working, textile production, pottery glazing

These can be considered for Phase 3 research planning.
