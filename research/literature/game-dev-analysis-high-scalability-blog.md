## Part I: MMORPG Architecture Case Studies

### 1. League of Legends - Riot Games Architecture

**Scale Metrics (from High Scalability):**
```
Daily Active Users: 27+ million
Peak Concurrent Players: 7.5+ million
Games per day: 1+ million
Geographic Regions: 13 worldwide
Server Infrastructure: 1000+ servers
Network Traffic: Multiple terabits/sec
```

**Key Architectural Patterns:**

**Regional Sharding Strategy:**
```
Riot's Approach (documented on High Scalability):

Geographic Shards:
- North America (NA)
- Europe West (EUW)
- Europe Nordic & East (EUNE)
- Korea (KR)
- China (Multiple regions)
- Southeast Asia, Brazil, Japan, etc.

Shard Independence:
✅ Each region has complete game infrastructure
✅ Player accounts tied to region
✅ No cross-region gameplay (by design)
✅ Independent scaling per region

Benefits:
- Reduced latency (players connect to nearby servers)
- Fault isolation (NA outage doesn't affect EU)
- Regulatory compliance (data residency)
- Independent deployment cadence

Challenges:
- Players can't play with friends in other regions
- Account migration is complex
- Must maintain feature parity across regions
```

**Match-Based Sharding Within Regions:**
```
Game Server Architecture:

Match Servers:
- Each game instance runs on dedicated server
- 10 players per match (5v5)
- 20-50 minute game duration
- Server terminates after match ends

Server Pool Management:
1. Pool of pre-warmed game servers
2. Matchmaking service assigns players
3. Server spun up for match
4. Players connect directly to game server
5. Results reported to platform
6. Server recycled to pool

Scaling Pattern:
- Peak hours: 100,000+ simultaneous matches
- Dynamic server provisioning (cloud auto-scaling)
- Can handle 10x traffic spikes during events
```

**Platform Services (Microservices Architecture):**
```
Service Breakdown (from Riot's tech talks):

Core Services:
1. Account Service: Login, authentication
2. Matchmaking Service: Player pairing, MMR calculation
3. Chat Service: In-game and client chat
4. Store Service: Purchases, virtual currency
5. Stats Service: Player statistics, leaderboards
6. Social Service: Friends list, presence

Infrastructure:
- Each service scales independently
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Distributed tracing for debugging

BlueMarble Application:
- Similar service decomposition
- Scale services based on load patterns
- Geological simulation could be separate service
- Resource economy as independent service
```

### 2. EVE Online - CCP Games Single-Shard Architecture

**Scale Metrics:**
```
Concurrent Players: 30,000-60,000 peak
Single Universe: One shared world (not sharded)
Server Hardware: High-end supercomputer-class
Uptime: 23 hours/day (daily maintenance)
Player Corporations: 10,000+
Economic Transactions: Billions of ISK daily
```

**Single-Shard Design Philosophy:**

```
Why Single Shard? (from CCP's High Scalability interview)

Benefits:
✅ All players in same universe
✅ Single player-driven economy
✅ Political meta-game across entire playerbase
✅ No fragmentation, no "dead servers"
✅ True MMO experience (everyone together)

Technical Challenges:
❌ Must handle all players on one cluster
❌ No geographic sharding (400ms latency for AU players)
❌ Single point of failure
❌ Complex load balancing
❌ Expensive hardware requirements

CCP's Solution: Solar System Sharding
- Universe has 5000+ solar systems
- Each system runs on dedicated node
- Players move between systems = move between servers
- Load balancing via system distribution
- Popular systems get beefier hardware
```

**Time Dilation (Innovative Solution for Large Battles):**

```
Problem: 1000+ players in single solar system
- Traditional approach: Server crashes or slows to unplayable FPS
- EVE's approach: Time Dilation

Time Dilation Mechanics:
- Server detects high load
- Slows down simulation time
- Game runs at 0.1x to 1.0x speed
- UI shows TiDi percentage
- All players experience same slowdown

Example:
- 2000 players in system
- Server overloaded
- TiDi kicks in at 10% (0.1x speed)
- 1 second in game = 10 seconds real time
- Combat is slow but playable
- Better than crashes or disconnects

Implementation:
```cpp
float CalculateTiDi(int playerCount, float serverLoad) {
    if (serverLoad < 0.8f && playerCount < 500) {
        return 1.0f;  // Normal time
    }
    
    // Calculate slowdown factor
    float loadFactor = 1.0f - min(serverLoad, 0.99f);
    float tidi = max(loadFactor, 0.1f);  // Min 10% speed
    
    return tidi;
}

void UpdateGameTick(float deltaTime, float tidi) {
    float adjustedDelta = deltaTime * tidi;
    UpdatePhysics(adjustedDelta);
    UpdateCombat(adjustedDelta);
    UpdateEconomy(adjustedDelta);
}
```

BlueMarble Application:
- Consider time dilation for geological events
- Slow down simulation during server stress
- Better than skipping frames or crashing
- Could apply to resource-intensive calculations
```

**EVE's Database Architecture:**

```
Database Design (from High Scalability case study):

Primary Database: Microsoft SQL Server
- Highly normalized schema
- 1TB+ database size
- ACID guarantees for critical operations

Caching Strategy:
- Redis for session data
- Memcached for frequently accessed data
- 90%+ cache hit rate

Sharding Approach (within single shard):
- Character data: By character ID
- Market data: By region
- Corporation data: By corporation ID
- Universe data: By solar system

Backup Strategy:
- Continuous replication to secondary
- Snapshot backups every 30 minutes
- Can restore to any point in time
- Daily full backups retained 30 days

Performance Optimization:
- Stored procedures for complex queries
- Aggressive indexing
- Partitioned tables
- Query optimization team
```

### 3. World of Warcraft - Blizzard's Realm Architecture

**Scale Metrics (Historical from High Scalability):**
```
Peak Subscribers: 12+ million
Realms (Servers): 200+ at peak
Players per Realm: 5,000-10,000
Concurrent Players: 500,000+ peak
Infrastructure Cost: $1M+/month (estimated)
```

**Realm-Based Sharding:**

```
WoW's Approach (documented architecture):

Realm = Shard:
- Each realm is independent game world
- Players choose realm during character creation
- Cannot interact with players on other realms (historically)
- Each realm has own economy, auction house, guilds

Realm Server Architecture:
```
Realm Components:
1. World Server: Handles game logic, NPCs, combat
2. Instance Servers: Dungeons, raids (separate from world)
3. Chat Servers: Cross-realm chat (later addition)
4. Auction House: Per-realm economy
5. Character Database: Player data for realm

Infrastructure per Realm:
- 4-8 blade servers
- 1 database server
- Shared authentication servers
- Shared login servers
```

Evolution: Cross-Realm Technology:
- Initially: Strict realm isolation
- Problem: Friends on different realms
- Solution: Cross-realm zones (CRZ)
- Later: Connected realms (merged populations)
- Modern: Dungeon finder across realms
```

**Instance Server Architecture:**

```
Dungeon/Raid Sharding:

Problem: 40 players in raid = intensive simulation
Solution: Dedicated instance servers

Instance Lifecycle:
1. Group enters dungeon
2. Instance server spun up
3. Players load into instance
4. Instance runs independently
5. Players complete/leave
6. Instance saved for lockout period
7. Server recycled after expiration

Scaling Benefits:
- World server only handles overworld
- Instance complexity isolated
- Can scale instance capacity independently
- Failed instance doesn't crash world server

BlueMarble Application:
- Mining operations as instances
- Deep drilling expeditions as instances
- Geological survey missions
- Isolates complex simulations
```

**WoW's Database Sharding:**

```
Database per Realm:

Schema Structure:
- Character_<realm>: Player data
- Guild_<realm>: Guild information
- Auction_<realm>: Economy data
- World_<realm>: World state

Global Databases:
- Account: Login credentials (shared)
- Achievement: Cross-realm achievements
- Collections: Mounts, pets (cross-realm)

Benefits:
- Horizontal scaling (add realms = add capacity)
- Fault isolation (one realm DB down ≠ all down)
- Simpler queries (no cross-realm joins)
- Easier sharding (realm = natural boundary)

Drawbacks:
- Cannot easily merge realms
- Fragmented player communities
- Load imbalance (popular realms overcrowded)
```

## Part II: Scalability Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Database Sharding Strategies

**Pattern Analysis from High Scalability Case Studies:**

**Geographic Sharding (Most Common for MMORPGs):**
```
Strategy: Shard by player location

Implementation:
```sql
-- Route player to database based on location
function GetDatabaseShard(playerId) {
    player = GetPlayerLocation(playerId);
    
    if (player.region == "North America") {
        return DB_NA;
    } else if (player.region == "Europe") {
        return DB_EU;
    } else if (player.region == "Asia") {
        return DB_ASIA;
    }
}
```

Pros:
✅ Reduced latency (data closer to players)
✅ Natural isolation boundary
✅ Regulatory compliance (GDPR, data residency)
✅ Simple routing logic

Cons:
❌ Cross-region features difficult
❌ Load imbalance (uneven populations)
❌ Cannot move players between regions easily

When to Use:
- Global game with regional communities
- Latency-sensitive gameplay
- Regulatory requirements
```

**Entity-Based Sharding (EVE Online Pattern):**
```
Strategy: Shard by game world entities (solar systems, zones)

Implementation:
```python
def get_shard_for_entity(entity_id):
    # Consistent hashing
    shard_count = 100
    shard_id = hash(entity_id) % shard_count
    return f"shard_{shard_id}"

# Entity locations stored in routing table
def get_player_shard(player_id):
    location = get_player_location(player_id)
    return get_shard_for_entity(location.zone_id)
```

Pros:
✅ Dynamic load balancing
✅ Can move entities between shards
✅ Scales with world size
✅ Hot zones can be isolated

Cons:
❌ Complex routing
❌ Cross-shard queries expensive
❌ Player movement = potential shard migration
❌ Need routing layer

When to Use:
- Large, continuous world
- Non-uniform player distribution
- Need dynamic rebalancing
```

**Functional Sharding (Riot Games Pattern):**
```
Strategy: Shard by system/feature

Implementation:
```
Services with Dedicated Databases:
1. Player Service → Player DB
2. Match Service → Match DB  
3. Social Service → Social DB
4. Store Service → Store DB
5. Stats Service → Stats DB

Each service:
- Owns its data
- Scales independently
- Can choose optimal database
- Isolated failures
```

Pros:
✅ Clear ownership boundaries
✅ Independent scaling
✅ Technology flexibility per service
✅ Fault isolation

Cons:
❌ Cross-service queries complex
❌ Distributed transactions difficult
❌ More infrastructure to manage
❌ Eventual consistency challenges

When to Use:
- Microservices architecture
- Services with different scaling needs
- Team ownership boundaries
```

**BlueMarble Recommended Approach:**

```
Hybrid Sharding Strategy:

Level 1: Geographic Sharding
- North America Cluster
- Europe Cluster  
- Asia Cluster

Level 2: Functional Sharding (within each region)
- Player Service
- Geological Service
- Economy Service
- Social Service

Level 3: Entity Sharding (Geological Service)
- Shard by 10km x 10km tiles
- Dynamic rebalancing
- Hot zones isolated

Benefits:
✅ Low latency (geographic)
✅ Clear service boundaries (functional)
✅ Scalable world simulation (entity-based)
✅ Fault isolation at multiple levels
```

### 2. Load Balancing Patterns

**Round-Robin vs. Least Connections:**

```
Pattern Comparison (from High Scalability case studies):

Round-Robin:
- Simple: Request 1 → Server A, Request 2 → Server B
- Pros: Simple, even distribution
- Cons: Doesn't account for server load
- Use Case: Stateless requests, uniform load

Least Connections:
- Smart: Route to server with fewest active connections
- Pros: Accounts for server load
- Cons: More complex, need to track connections
- Use Case: Long-lived connections, variable load

Weighted Round-Robin:
- Hybrid: Server capacity weights
- Pros: Can adjust for different hardware
- Cons: Need to configure weights
- Use Case: Heterogeneous server hardware
```

**Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions):**

```
Problem: Player state in memory on server
Solution: Route player to same server

Implementation:
```nginx
# Nginx config for sticky sessions
upstream game_servers {
    ip_hash;  # Hash client IP to consistent server
    server game1.example.com:7777;
    server game2.example.com:7777;
    server game3.example.com:7777;
}
```

Alternative: Session Token Hash:
```python
def get_server_for_player(player_id, server_pool):
    # Consistent hashing
    server_index = hash(player_id) % len(server_pool)
    return server_pool[server_index]
```

Pros:
✅ Player always routed to same server
✅ Server-side state remains valid
✅ Reduced database queries

Cons:
❌ Uneven load distribution
❌ Server failure = all sessions lost
❌ Difficult to scale down

High Scalability Recommendation:
- Use for game servers (stateful)
- Avoid for API servers (make stateless)
- Implement graceful connection migration
```

**Geographic Load Balancing:**

```
Pattern: Route players to nearest region

Implementation (DNS-based):
```
GeoDNS Configuration:
game.bluemarble.com resolves to:
- North America: 192.0.2.1
- Europe: 198.51.100.1
- Asia: 203.0.113.1

Based on player's IP geolocation
```

Implementation (Application-layer):
```python
def get_best_region(player_ip):
    player_location = geolocate(player_ip)
    
    regions = [
        {"name": "NA", "latency": ping("na.bluemarble.com")},
        {"name": "EU", "latency": ping("eu.bluemarble.com")},
        {"name": "AS", "latency": ping("as.bluemarble.com")}
    ]
    
    # Sort by latency, return best
    return min(regions, key=lambda r: r["latency"])
```

Benefits:
- Reduced latency (100-200ms improvement)
- Better player experience
- Regional load distribution
```

---

### 3. Caching Strategies

**Multi-Tier Caching (from Netflix, applicable to games):**

```
Caching Hierarchy:

L1: In-Memory (Application Server)
- Player session data
- Recently accessed entities
- 10-100ms lifespan
- Size: 100MB-1GB per server

L2: Redis/Memcached (Distributed Cache)
- Player profiles
- Item templates
- World state snapshots
- 1-60 minute lifespan
- Size: 10-100GB cluster

L3: Database (Persistent Storage)
- Authoritative data
- Cold storage
- Infinite lifespan
- Size: 100GB-10TB

Query Flow:
1. Check L1 cache
2. If miss, check L2 cache
3. If miss, query L3 database
4. Populate L1 and L2 on hit
```

**Cache Invalidation Patterns:**

```
Pattern 1: Time-Based (TTL)
```python
cache.set("player:123", player_data, ttl=300)  # 5 minutes

Pros: Simple, automatic cleanup
Cons: Stale data for TTL duration
Use: Rarely changing data (item templates)
```

Pattern 2: Write-Through
```python
def update_player(player_id, data):
    # Update database first
    database.update(player_id, data)
    # Then update cache
    cache.set(f"player:{player_id}", data)

Pros: Cache always fresh
Cons: Write latency increased
Use: Critical data (player health, position)
```

Pattern 3: Write-Behind (Lazy)
```python
def update_player(player_id, data):
    # Update cache immediately
    cache.set(f"player:{player_id}", data)
    # Queue database update
    queue.enqueue("update_player", player_id, data)

Pros: Low write latency
Cons: Risk of data loss if cache fails
Use: High-frequency updates (movement)
```

BlueMarble Strategy:
- Player position: Write-behind (high frequency)
- Inventory: Write-through (critical)
- Geological data: Time-based TTL (slow changes)
```

**Cache Warming:**

```
Strategy: Pre-populate cache before traffic spike

Implementation:
```python
def warm_cache_for_event():
    # Before server event, load popular data
    popular_zones = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]  # High traffic areas
    
    for zone_id in popular_zones:
        # Load geological data
        geo_data = database.get_geological_data(zone_id)
        cache.set(f"geo:{zone_id}", geo_data)
        
        # Load entity data
        entities = database.get_zone_entities(zone_id)
        cache.set(f"entities:{zone_id}", entities)
    
    print("Cache warmed for event")
```

Timing:
- Run during maintenance window
- Before marketing campaigns
- Before content releases
- After cache cluster restart

Benefits:
- Prevents cold-start database overload
- Consistent performance from launch
- Predictable user experience
```

---

### 4. Queue-Based Architecture

**Event-Driven Processing (from Riot Games):**

```
Pattern: Decouple services with message queues

Architecture:
```
Player Action → API Server → Message Queue → Worker Pool → Database

Components:
1. API Server: Accepts requests, validates, queues
2. Message Queue: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams
3. Worker Pool: Process messages async
4. Database: Persistent storage

Example: Player Gathering Resource
```python
# API Server (fast response)
@app.post("/gather")
def gather_resource(player_id, resource_id):
    # Validate request
    if not is_valid_gather(player_id, resource_id):
        return {"error": "Invalid gather"}
    
    # Queue for processing
    queue.publish("gather_queue", {
        "player_id": player_id,
        "resource_id": resource_id,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    # Immediate response
    return {"status": "queued", "estimated_time": "1-2s"}

# Worker (async processing)
def process_gather_queue():
    while True:
        msg = queue.consume("gather_queue")
        
        # Validate (again, could be stale)
        if not is_still_valid_gather(msg):
            continue
        
        # Process gathering
        result = perform_gather(msg.player_id, msg.resource_id)
        
        # Update database
        database.add_resource(msg.player_id, result)
        
        # Notify player via websocket
        notify_player(msg.player_id, result)
```

Benefits:
✅ API responds in <10ms (just queues)
✅ Heavy processing doesn't block requests
✅ Can scale workers independently
✅ Automatic retry on failure
✅ Smooth out traffic spikes

Challenges:
❌ Eventual consistency (slight delay)
❌ More complex architecture
❌ Need monitoring for queue depth
❌ Potential message loss (need durability)
```

**Priority Queues:**

```
Pattern: Process critical actions first

Implementation:
```python
# Multiple queues with priorities
queues = {
    "critical": [],   # Combat, death, disconnects
    "high": [],       # Trading, gathering
    "normal": [],     # Movement, chat
    "low": []         # Analytics, stats
}

def worker_process():
    while True:
        # Process highest priority first
        for priority in ["critical", "high", "normal", "low"]:
            if queues[priority]:
                msg = queues[priority].pop(0)
                process_message(msg)
                break
        else:
            time.sleep(0.01)  # No messages, brief sleep
```

Use Cases:
- Critical: Account security, payment processing
- High: Gameplay actions (combat, trading)
- Normal: Social features (chat, friends)
- Low: Background tasks (analytics, logs)
```

## Part III: Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Infrastructure Cost Analysis

**Cloud Cost Breakdown (from various High Scalability case studies):**

```
Typical MMORPG Infrastructure Costs:

Compute (40-50% of total):
- Game servers: $0.10-0.50/hour per instance
- 100 game servers: $720-3,600/month
- API servers: $0.05-0.20/hour per instance
- 20 API servers: $72-288/month

Database (20-30%):
- Managed PostgreSQL: $0.30-1.00/hour
- 3 database instances: $216-720/month
- Read replicas: $0.15-0.50/hour each
- 5 replicas: $108-360/month

Storage (10-15%):
- Block storage: $0.10/GB/month
- 10TB storage: $1,000/month
- Object storage: $0.02/GB/month
- Backups: $0.01/GB/month

Network (10-15%):
- Data transfer out: $0.08-0.12/GB
- 10TB/month: $800-1,200/month
- Data transfer in: Free

Total Estimate for 1000 Players:
- Compute: $800-4,000/month
- Database: $300-1,000/month
- Storage: $1,000-2,000/month
- Network: $800-1,200/month
- Total: $3,000-8,000/month

Scaling to 10,000 Players:
- ~10x infrastructure: $30,000-80,000/month
- Economy of scale: ~8x (not linear)
- Realistic: $25,000-60,000/month
```

**Cost Optimization Tactics:**

```
1. Reserved Instances (30-70% savings):
- Commit to 1-3 year terms
- Significant discounts
- Use for baseline capacity

2. Spot Instances (50-90% savings):
- For non-critical workloads
- Analytics, processing, batch jobs
- Can be terminated anytime

3. Auto-Scaling:
- Scale up during peak hours
- Scale down during off-hours
- Save 20-40% on idle capacity

4. Right-Sizing:
- Monitor actual usage
- Downsize over-provisioned instances
- Save 10-30% on wasted resources

5. Storage Tiering:
- Hot data: SSD (expensive)
- Warm data: HDD (cheaper)
- Cold data: Archive (cheapest)
- Save 40-60% on storage costs
```

---

### 2. Performance vs. Cost Trade-offs

**Decision Framework (from High Scalability):**

```
When to Optimize Performance (Spend More):
✅ Player-facing latency (< 100ms critical)
✅ Combat/action responsiveness
✅ Login/authentication speed
✅ Payment processing reliability

When to Accept Slower Performance (Save Money):
✅ Analytics processing (batch overnight)
✅ Leaderboard updates (5-minute delay acceptable)
✅ Email notifications (can queue)
✅ Backup processes (off-peak hours)

Example: Geological Simulation
- Real-time simulation: Expensive (compute-intensive)
- Pre-calculated: Cheap (batch processing)
- Hybrid: Smart (cache results, update periodically)

BlueMarble Strategy:
```python
# Real-time for player-visible events
def update_active_geology():
    active_zones = get_zones_with_players()
    for zone in active_zones:
        simulate_geology(zone, full_detail=True)

# Batch for background
def update_background_geology():
    inactive_zones = get_zones_without_players()
    for zone in inactive_zones:
        simulate_geology(zone, low_detail=True)
    
# Schedule background updates at night
schedule.every().day.at("03:00").do(update_background_geology)
```
```

## Part IV: Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics That Matter

**Golden Signals (from Google SRE, featured on High Scalability):**

```
1. Latency: How long requests take
- P50: 50% of requests faster than X
- P95: 95% of requests faster than X
- P99: 99% of requests faster than X

Target: P95 < 100ms for API, P99 < 200ms

2. Traffic: Request rate
- Requests per second
- Concurrent players
- Bandwidth usage

Target: Track trends, set capacity alerts

3. Errors: Failure rate
- 5xx server errors
- 4xx client errors
- Database connection failures

Target: Error rate < 0.1%

4. Saturation: Resource utilization
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network bandwidth

Target: < 80% utilization (room for spikes)
```

**Game-Specific Metrics:**

```
Player Experience Metrics:
- Average FPS (client-side)
- Network latency (RTT)
- Packet loss rate
- Disconnection rate

Server Performance Metrics:
- Tick rate (Hz)
- Entity count per zone
- Database query time
- Cache hit rate

Business Metrics:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Average session duration
- Revenue per user

Implementation:
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Request metrics
request_count = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')
active_players = Gauge('active_players', 'Current player count')

### 2. Alerting Best Practices

**Alert Pyramid (from High Scalability SRE practices):**

```
Level 1: Critical (Page On-Call Engineer)
- Service down
- Error rate > 5%
- P95 latency > 500ms
- Database unavailable

Level 2: High (Slack/Email Alert)
- Error rate > 1%
- P95 latency > 200ms
- Disk > 80% full
- Memory > 85% used

Level 3: Medium (Dashboard/Log)
- Error rate > 0.1%
- P95 latency > 150ms
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Cache misses increasing

Level 4: Low (Weekly Review)
- Long-term trends
- Cost overruns
- Performance regression
- Technical debt

Alert Fatigue Prevention:
- Don't alert on symptoms, alert on impact
- Set appropriate thresholds (not too sensitive)
- Auto-resolve when condition clears
- Aggregate related alerts
```

## Part V: Failure Modes and Resilience

### 1. Common Failure Patterns

**Database Failures (Most Common):**

```
Failure: Primary database crashes

Traditional Response: ❌
- Service goes down
- Players disconnected
- Data loss risk
- Manual failover (slow)

High Availability Pattern: ✅
- Automatic failover to replica
- < 30 second downtime
- No data loss (synchronous replication)
- Health checks trigger failover

Implementation:
```bash
# PostgreSQL with automatic failover
pgpool-II configuration:
- Primary: db1.example.com
- Replica: db2.example.com
- Failover time: < 10 seconds
- Health check: Every 5 seconds

# When primary fails:
1. pgpool detects failure (5-10s)
2. Promotes replica to primary
3. Redirects traffic to new primary
4. Old primary becomes replica when recovered
```
```

**Cascading Failures:**

```
Pattern: One failure triggers more failures

Example Cascade:
1. Database slow (high load)
2. API servers queue requests (waiting on DB)
3. Connection pool exhausted
4. New requests fail immediately
5. Clients retry aggressively
6. More load on already struggling system
7. Complete service outage

Prevention Strategies:

1. Circuit Breakers:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failures = 0
        self.threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.last_failure = 0
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    def call(self, func):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure > self.timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpen()
        
        try:
            result = func()
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failures = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failures += 1
            self.last_failure = time.time()
            if self.failures >= self.threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
            raise
```

2. Bulkheads:
- Isolate thread pools per service
- Database failure doesn't exhaust all threads
- Other services continue functioning

3. Timeouts:
- Set aggressive timeouts (1-5 seconds)
- Fail fast rather than queue indefinitely
- Allow system to recover
```

---

### 2. Disaster Recovery

**Backup Strategies (from production case studies):**

```
Tier 1: Critical Data (Player Accounts, Inventory)
- Real-time replication
- RPO: 0 seconds (no data loss)
- RTO: < 1 minute (recovery time)
- Cost: High

Tier 2: Important Data (World State, Economy)
- 5-minute incremental backups
- RPO: 5 minutes
- RTO: < 15 minutes
- Cost: Medium

Tier 3: Non-Critical Data (Logs, Analytics)
- Daily backups
- RPO: 24 hours
- RTO: < 4 hours
- Cost: Low

Implementation:
```bash
# PostgreSQL continuous archiving
postgresql.conf:
wal_level = replica
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /backup/archive/%f'

# Recovery procedure
1. Restore from last full backup
2. Apply WAL archives
3. Recover to specific point in time
4. Verify data integrity
5. Switch traffic to recovered instance
```
```
