## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `topic-name.md` (e.g., `mmo-architecture-patterns.md`)
- Keep files focused on one topic (200-400 lines)
- Include proper citations and references
- Link to full sources in `../sources/sources.bib` when applicable

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `player-retention-studies-2024.md` not `studies.md`
- Include dates for time-sensitive research
