# Research Literature

This directory contains formal references, summaries, and literature reviews for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Store summaries of academic papers, articles, and technical documentation
- Organize external research that informs design decisions
- Maintain bibliographic references and citations

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `topic-name.md` (e.g., `mmo-architecture-patterns.md`)
- Keep files focused on one topic (200-400 lines)
- Include proper citations and references
- Link to full sources in `../sources/sources.bib` when applicable

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `player-retention-studies-2024.md` not `studies.md`
- Include dates for time-sensitive research
