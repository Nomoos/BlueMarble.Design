## Executive Summary

Greg Costikyan's "Uncertainty in Games" (2013) provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and designing around different types of uncertainty in game systems. This book-length work expands on his earlier vocabulary development efforts, establishing precise terminology for information states, uncertainty sources, and player decision-making under incomplete knowledge.

**Key Finding for BlueMarble:** Geological exploration and mineral extraction are fundamentally exercises in managing uncertainty. Costikyan's framework provides the vocabulary and design patterns needed to create engaging decision-making systems where players balance risk, gather information, and make strategic choices under uncertainty.

### Core Uncertainty Types Identified

1. **Performative Uncertainty** - Skill-based unpredictability in execution
2. **Solver's Uncertainty** - Puzzle-solving with hidden solutions
3. **Analytic Complexity** - Decision-making with too many variables
4. **Hidden Information** - Strategic information asymmetry
5. **Randomness** - Stochastic system elements
6. **Opponent Unpredictability** - Actions of other intelligent agents
7. **Development Uncertainty** - Narrative and long-term progression unknowns
8. **Semiotic Uncertainty** - Unclear system communication

**BlueMarble Relevance:** 7/8 uncertainty types directly applicable to geological simulation, with opponent unpredictability replaced by geological system complexity.

## Source Overview

**Title:** Uncertainty in Games  
**Author:** Greg Costikyan  
**Published:** 2013, MIT Press  
**Type:** Academic monograph  
**Length:** ~200 pages  
**Focus:** Information theory applied to game design  

### Context

Building on his 2002 paper "I Have No Words & I Must Design," Costikyan develops a comprehensive vocabulary for discussing uncertainty in games. The book establishes uncertainty as the fundamental element that makes games engaging, arguing that meaningful play emerges from navigating information states and managing risk.

### Theoretical Foundation

- **Information Theory** (Shannon, 1948): Uncertainty as measurable information entropy
- **Game Theory** (von Neumann & Morgenstern): Decision-making under uncertainty
- **Cognitive Psychology**: Player mental models and prediction
- **Ludology**: Uncertainty as core game mechanic rather than narrative element

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Uncertainty Principle in Games

**Central Thesis:** Games are fundamentally about managing uncertainty. Without uncertainty, there are no meaningful decisions, no engagement, and ultimately no game.

#### Certainty Kills Engagement

When outcomes are certain, players disengage:
- **Perfect Information + Determined Outcome = Boredom**
- Tic-tac-toe example: Solved game with perfect play becomes unplayable
- Chess at high skill levels: Opening theory removes early-game uncertainty

#### Uncertainty Creates Agency

Players experience agency when their decisions matter:
- Decisions only matter when outcomes are uncertain
- Uncertainty requires information gathering
- Information gathering drives exploration and experimentation
- Experimentation creates learning and mastery

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Geological Uncertainty Progression:

Initial State (High Uncertainty):
- Unknown mineral distribution
- Unclear geological processes
- Uncertain extraction outcomes

Information Gathering:
- Surface surveys reduce location uncertainty
- Core samples reduce composition uncertainty
- Historical data reduces process uncertainty

Informed Decisions:
- Where to dig (balanced risk/reward)
- What tools to use (technique uncertainty)
- When to extract vs. preserve (value uncertainty)

Outcome Uncertainty Remains:
- Exact quantities unknown until extraction
- Tool durability variation
- Processing yield variability
```

### 2. Eight Types of Uncertainty

Costikyan's taxonomy provides precise vocabulary for discussing different uncertainty sources:

#### 2.1 Performative Uncertainty

**Definition:** Uncertainty arising from player skill execution challenges.

**Characteristics:**
- Physical or mental dexterity required
- Practice improves outcomes but doesn't eliminate uncertainty
- Real-time decision pressure
- Hand-eye coordination, timing, precision

**Examples:**
- Platformer jump timing
- First-person shooter aim
- Fighting game combo execution
- Rhythm game beat matching

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Performative Uncertainty in Geological Work:

Manual Extraction:
- Hammer strike precision (damage vs. preservation)
- Chisel placement accuracy (fracture control)
- Brush cleaning delicacy (detail vs. speed)

Sample Preparation:
- Thin section cutting precision
- Grinding uniform thickness
- Polishing without surface damage

Tool Operation:
- Drill bit pressure control
- Core barrel advancement rate
- Explosive placement for quarrying
```

**Design Considerations:**
- Balance skill ceiling with accessibility
- Provide practice opportunities
- Show execution feedback clearly
- Allow skill expression variety

#### 2.2 Solver's Uncertainty

**Definition:** Uncertainty in puzzle-solving where solution exists but is hidden from player.

**Characteristics:**
- Hidden but deterministic solution
- Information gathering reveals solution elements
- "Aha!" moment when pattern recognized
- Solution persists across attempts

**Examples:**
- Adventure game puzzles
- Mystery narrative investigation
- Escape room challenges
- Archaeological site interpretation

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Solver's Uncertainty in Geology:

Mineral Identification Puzzle:
Known Properties:
- Color: Green
- Hardness: 6.5-7
- Crystal form: Prismatic
- Occurrence: Metamorphic rocks

Solution Path:
1. Hardness test narrows to ~20 minerals
2. Color + hardness → 5 candidates
3. Crystal form → 2 likely matches
4. Rock type context → Identified: Epidote

Geological Process Mystery:
Observed Evidence:
- Layered sedimentary rocks
- Folded and faulted
- Contact metamorphism
- Mineral assemblages

Solution Path:
1. Deposition in sedimentary basin
2. Tectonic compression and folding
3. Magmatic intrusion and metamorphism
4. Uplift and erosion exposure
```

**Design Principles:**
- Provide sufficient clues without obvious solutions
- Reward systematic information gathering
- Allow multiple solution approaches
- Create satisfying revelation moments

#### 2.3 Analytic Complexity

**Definition:** Uncertainty from excessive decision variables exceeding cognitive capacity.

**Characteristics:**
- Perfect information available but too complex to analyze
- Chess mid-game: All pieces visible but impossible to calculate all outcomes
- Overwhelming option space
- Analysis paralysis potential

**Examples:**
- Strategy game with dozens of unit types and buildings
- City builder with interconnected systems
- Complex card game state spaces
- Economic simulation with multiple variables

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Analytic Complexity in Geological Systems:

Deposit Assessment Decision:
Variables to Consider:
- Mineral type (50+ possibilities)
- Concentration/grade (continuous variable)
- Depth (affects extraction cost)
- Rock hardness (affects tool wear)
- Water table presence (affects method)
- Structural complexity (fault zones)
- Distance from base (logistics cost)
- Current market prices (economic factor)
- Tool inventory (resource constraint)
- Energy available (power constraint)
- Weather conditions (accessibility)
- Season (ground freeze/thaw)

Result: ~100,000+ possible outcome combinations
Player uses heuristics and experience rather than exhaustive analysis
```

**Management Strategies:**
- Provide high-level summary information
- Create visual data representations
- Enable "good enough" decision-making
- Offer simplified analysis tools
- Support chunking related variables

#### 2.4 Hidden Information

**Definition:** Strategic uncertainty from information asymmetry between players or player and system.

**Characteristics:**
- Information exists but is concealed
- Strategic advantage from information control
- Bluffing and deception potential
- Information revelation as strategic resource

**Examples:**
- Card games with hidden hands
- Fog of war in strategy games
- Stealth game guard knowledge
- Economic games with private resources

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Hidden Information in Geological Exploration:

Subsurface Mineral Distribution:

```

**Design Principles:**
- Make information gathering meaningful
- Create strategic choices about investigation depth
- Reward both bold decisions and thorough research
- Balance information cost with value
- Provide partial information that enables informed risk-taking

#### 2.5 Randomness

**Definition:** Uncertainty from stochastic system elements with probability distributions.

- Critical hit chances
- Card shuffle randomness

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Randomness in Geological Systems:

Tool Durability:
Mean Lifetime: 100 uses

- Operator skill (-10 to +5%)
- Material properties (-5 to +15%)

Player Experience:
- Consistent expectations over time
- Interesting variance per operation
- Optimization opportunities
- Risk management strategies
```

**Design Principles:**
- Use transparent probability when possible
- Provide statistical feedback over time
- Avoid frustrating rare negative outcomes
- Balance lucky breaks with unlucky breaks
- Create meaningful choices around risk

#### 2.6 Opponent Unpredictability

**Definition:** Uncertainty from intelligent agent behavior that cannot be perfectly predicted.

**Characteristics:**
- Emerges from opponent decision-making
- Strategic depth from modeling opponent
- Psychological warfare potential
- Adaptive and responsive

**Examples:**
- Multiplayer competition
- AI opponents with multiple strategies
- Negotiation and diplomacy
- Bluffing and misdirection

**BlueMarble Application (Modified):**

While BlueMarble is primarily single-player, this uncertainty type transforms into:

```
Geological System Complexity Uncertainty:

Dynamic Geological Processes:
- Weathering rates vary with conditions
- Erosion unpredictably exposes materials
- Groundwater flow changes seasonally
- Structural stability affected by extraction

System Response to Player Actions:
- Removing support rock affects stability
- Water management impacts other areas
- Extraction changes stress patterns
- Environmental effects have delayed consequences

Example: Quarry Wall Stability
Player Action: Extract 1000 cubic meters of rock
System Response (uncertain):
- Wall remains stable (60% probability)
- Minor cracking occurs (30% probability)
- Significant instability develops (8% probability)
- Catastrophic failure (2% probability)

Factors (partially hidden):
- Rock structural properties
- Existing fracture network
- Water saturation level
- Excavation geometry
- Time since last extraction

Player Strategy:
- Monitor for warning signs
- Employ preventive measures
- Balance risk vs. extraction speed
- Maintain safety margins
```

**Design Principles:**
- Create responsive systems with delayed feedback
- Make system state partially observable
- Reward careful observation and prediction
- Allow experimentation and learning
- Provide subtle signals before major events

#### 2.7 Development Uncertainty

**Definition:** Uncertainty about long-term narrative or progression outcomes.

**Characteristics:**
- Story-driven suspense
- Character development unknowns
- Tech tree exploration
- Long-term goal achievement paths

**Examples:**
- RPG narrative branches
- Roguelike character builds
- 4X game technology paths
- Branching dialogue outcomes

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Development Uncertainty in Geological Discovery:

Knowledge Progression Path:
Initial State:
- Limited geological knowledge
- Basic mineral identification
- Simple extraction tools

Uncertain Development Branches:
1. Specialization Path
   - Focus: Deep expertise in specific minerals
   - Unlock: Advanced processing for rare elements
   - Trade-off: Limited breadth

2. Generalist Path
   - Focus: Broad knowledge across mineral types
   - Unlock: Identification efficiency
   - Trade-off: Less processing depth

3. Technology Path
   - Focus: Advanced equipment and techniques
   - Unlock: Mechanized extraction
   - Trade-off: High capital requirement

4. Naturalist Path
   - Focus: Geological interpretation
   - Unlock: Prospecting expertise
   - Trade-off: Manual methods

Narrative Discovery Uncertainty:
- What geological history will site reveal?
- Which major deposits will be discovered?
- How did landscape form?
- What environmental changes occurred?

Long-term Goal Uncertainty:
- Will rare earth deposit be located?
- Can sustainable extraction be achieved?
- What complete collection looks like?
- How deep can excavation go?
```

**Design Principles:**
- Create multiple viable progression paths
- Make choices meaningful but not punishing
- Reveal progression options gradually
- Support experimentation and respecialization
- Provide narrative payoffs for exploration

#### 2.8 Semiotic Uncertainty

**Definition:** Uncertainty from unclear or ambiguous system communication.

**Characteristics:**
- System state exists but isn't clearly communicated
- Ambiguous interface feedback
- Unclear cause-and-effect relationships
- Learning curve from interpreting signals

**Examples:**
- Opaque simulation mechanics
- Unclear status icons
- Ambiguous audio cues
- Complex system interactions without documentation

**BlueMarble Application (To Minimize):**
```
Intentional Semiotic Uncertainty:

Mineral Identification Learning:
Initial Experience:
- Player sees rock with "green crystals"
- No automatic identification
- Must compare to reference materials
- Learn diagnostic properties

Progression:
Beginner → "It's a green mineral"
Intermediate → "It's a green silicate, hardness 6-7"
Advanced → "It's epidote based on color, hardness, and occurrence"
Expert → "Epidote with characteristic pistachio green and vitreous luster"

Geological Process Interpretation:
Initial: "These rocks are layered and bent"
Intermediate: "Sedimentary rocks have been folded"
Advanced: "Syncline fold in metamorphosed sedimentary sequence"
Expert: "Recumbent syncline with contact metamorphic aureole from later intrusion"

Accidental Semiotic Uncertainty (To Avoid):

Bad: Tool durability shown as 0-100% with no indication of rate of decay
Good: Tool durability shows percentage, uses remaining, and expected failure range

Bad: Mineral value shown as "High" or "Low" without reference
Good: Mineral value shown as currency amount with market context

Bad: Rock hardness described as "Tough"
Good: Rock hardness shown on Mohs scale (1-10) with reference examples
```

**Design Principles:**
- Intentional complexity supports learning
- Provide reference materials for interpretation
- Clear feedback for system mechanics
- Ambiguity only where educational value exists
- Progressive disclosure of system details

### 3. Information Gathering as Core Gameplay

Costikyan argues that uncertainty drives information gathering, which becomes the primary player activity:

#### The Information Gathering Loop

```
High Uncertainty State
      ↓
Player Makes Decision to Gather Information
      ↓
Choose Information Gathering Method
      ↓
Execute Information Gathering (cost/risk)
      ↓
Receive Partial Information
      ↓
Update Mental Model of System
      ↓
Reduced (but not eliminated) Uncertainty
      ↓
Make Strategic Decision
      ↓
Execute Action
      ↓
Observe Outcome
      ↓
Learn from Outcome (more information)
      ↓
Next Uncertainty State
```

**BlueMarble Implementation:**

```
Geological Information Gathering Gameplay Loop:

1. Initial Survey (Low Cost, Low Precision)
   Methods:
   - Visual observation
   - Color and texture analysis
   - Rock type identification
   - Topographic assessment
   
   Information Gained:
   - General geology
   - Surface minerals
   - Structural features
   - Accessibility

2. Detailed Investigation (Medium Cost, Medium Precision)
   Methods:
   - Geophysical surveys
   - Surface sampling
   - Geochemical analysis
   - Geological mapping
   
   Information Gained:
   - Subsurface structure
   - Mineral distribution patterns
   - Deposit dimensions
   - Grade estimates

3. Intensive Analysis (High Cost, High Precision)
   Methods:
   - Core drilling
   - Laboratory assays
   - 3D modeling
   - Geostatistical analysis
   
   Information Gained:
   - Exact composition
   - Precise locations

   - Unexpected factors
```

#### Information Value vs. Cost

Players must balance:
- **Information Cost:** Time, money, equipment, risk
- **Information Value:** Reduction in decision uncertainty
- **Decision Stakes:** Consequences of being wrong

**Example Decision Matrix:**
```
Small Test Dig (Low Stakes):
- Information Gathering: Minimal (quick visual check)
- Risk: Waste a few hours if wrong
- Reward: Small material gain

Medium Mining Operation (Medium Stakes):
- Information Gathering: Moderate (surface samples + basic survey)
- Risk: Waste several days and equipment if wrong
- Reward: Significant material and economic gain

Major Quarry Development (High Stakes):
- Information Gathering: Extensive (drilling, assays, modeling)
- Risk: Month+ investment loss if wrong
- Reward: Transform entire operation if successful
```

### 4. Managing Uncertainty for Engagement

Costikyan provides principles for designing engaging uncertainty:

#### 4.1 Optimal Uncertainty Levels

**Too Little Uncertainty:**
- Deterministic outcomes
- Rote execution
- No meaningful decisions
- Player disengagement

**Too Much Uncertainty:**
- Random outcomes dominate
- Decisions feel meaningless
- No skill expression
- Player frustration

**Optimal Uncertainty:**
- Meaningful decisions
- Skill matters
- Some luck/variance
- Engaging risk/reward
- Learning opportunities

**BlueMarble Calibration:**
```
Certainty ←──────────────────────────────→ Randomness
    0%    25%           50%           75%    100%

Optimal Ranges by Activity:

Mineral Identification (Skill-Based):
├────────┤ 10-30% uncertainty
Heavy skill influence, some ambiguity

Extraction Yield (Mixed):
      ├──────────┤ 30-50% uncertainty
      Balance of technique and variation

Tool Durability (Stochastic):
                ├──────────┤ 40-60% uncertainty
                Predictable range, variable timing

Discovery Locations (Hidden Info):
                      ├────────────┤ 60-80% uncertainty
                      Exploration-driven reduction

Market Prices (External):
                            ├──────┤ 70-85% uncertainty
                            Limited player control
```

#### 4.2 Layered Uncertainty

Combine multiple uncertainty types for depth:

**Single-Layer (Simple):**
"Will this dice roll succeed?" (Pure randomness)

**Multi-Layer (Complex):**
```
BlueMarble Extraction Decision:

Layer 1: Hidden Information
- Where is the ore deposit? (geological uncertainty)

Layer 2: Solver's Uncertainty  
- What mineral is it? (identification puzzle)

Layer 3: Analytic Complexity
- Is it worth extracting? (economic calculation)

Layer 4: Performative Uncertainty
- Can I extract cleanly? (execution skill)

Layer 5: Randomness
- What exact yield will I get? (stochastic variation)

Layer 6: Development Uncertainty
- How will this affect long-term goals? (strategic impact)

Result: Deep, engaging decision-making with multiple considerations
```

#### 4.3 Uncertainty Reduction Progression

Design uncertainty to decrease with player mastery:

**Novice Player:**
- High uncertainty across all types
- Limited information gathering tools
- Unclear system mechanics
- Random-feeling outcomes

**Intermediate Player:**
- Reduced semiotic uncertainty (understands UI)
- Some solver's uncertainty resolved (knows common patterns)
- Developing performative skill
- Better information gathering efficiency

**Expert Player:**
- Minimal semiotic uncertainty (fluent reading)
- Most solver's patterns known
- High performative skill
- Optimal information gathering strategies
- Focus on analytic complexity and strategic development

**BlueMarble Progression:**
```
Beginner Geologist:
- Can't identify minerals reliably
- Unsure where to look
- Inefficient extraction
- Poor resource management
Feels uncertain about everything

Journeyman Geologist:
- Identifies common minerals quickly
- Recognizes favorable geological settings
- Competent extraction technique
- Reasonable resource planning
Confident in routine situations, uncertain in novel ones

Master Geologist:
- Rapid, accurate identification
- Predictive prospecting ability
- Efficient, clean extraction
- Optimal strategic planning
Uncertainty remains in complex decisions and rare situations
```

### 5. Uncertainty and Agency

Costikyan's key insight: **Uncertainty creates agency by making decisions matter.**

#### The Agency-Uncertainty Relationship

**No Uncertainty = No Agency:**
```
Deterministic System:
- Player chooses Action A
- Outcome X occurs (100% certain)
- Choice didn't matter (same outcome regardless)
- No agency experienced
```

**Uncertainty Creates Agency:**
```
Uncertain System:
- Player chooses Action A
- Outcome distribution: 60% success, 30% partial, 10% failure
- Player influences probability through:
  - Information gathering (reduce uncertainty)
  - Skill development (improve odds)
  - Strategic planning (optimize approach)
- Choice matters because it changes likelihood
- Agency experienced through meaningful influence
```

**BlueMarble Agency Model:**
```
Geological Prospecting Decision:

Option A: Excavate Here
- Estimated ore grade: 2.5% (±1.2%)
- Depth: Shallow (easy access)
- Risk: Low (stable rock)
- Information quality: Medium (surface samples only)

Option B: Excavate There
- Estimated ore grade: 4.1% (±2.8%)
- Depth: Deep (difficult access)
- Risk: Medium (fractured rock)
- Information quality: Low (inferred from surveys)

Option C: Gather More Information First
- Additional survey cost: 2 days, moderate equipment
- Estimated uncertainty reduction: ±1.2% → ±0.5%
- Delays extraction start
- Reduces risk of wrong decision

Player Agency:
- Each choice has different risk/reward profile
- Information gathering changes decision confidence
- Skill in interpretation improves estimates
- Strategic thinking optimizes approach
- Outcome uncertain but influenced by player choices
```

#### Meaningful Choices Under Uncertainty

For choices to be meaningful:

1. **Outcomes must be uncertain** (or choice is trivial)
2. **Player must influence probability** (or choice is meaningless)
3. **Outcomes must matter** (or choice has no stakes)
4. **Player must understand trade-offs** (or choice is random)

**BlueMarble Choice Quality:**
```
Good Choice: Extraction Method Selection

Option A: Manual Extraction
- Pros: High specimen quality, precise control, low equipment cost
- Cons: Slow, labor-intensive, limited volume
- Uncertainty: Specimen damage (5-15%), extraction time (±30%)

Option B: Mechanical Extraction
- Pros: Fast, high volume, consistent results
- Cons: Lower specimen quality, high equipment cost, less selective
- Uncertainty: Equipment failure (2-8%), yield variance (±20%)

Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Pros: Balanced quality and speed
- Cons: Requires both skill sets, equipment switching overhead
- Uncertainty: Method selection per specimen (requires judgment)

Analysis:
✓ Outcomes uncertain (success rates vary)
✓ Player influences (skill and approach matter)
✓ Outcomes matter (affects profit, collections, goals)
✓ Trade-offs clear (explicit pros/cons)
= Meaningful choice
```

### 6. Uncertainty Communication

Costikyan emphasizes clear communication of uncertainty to enable informed decision-making:

#### Displaying Uncertainty Effectively

**Bad: Hide Information Completely**
```
Tool Condition: "Worn"
Problem: No actionable information
Player can't make informed decision about replacement timing
```

**Better: Show State Without Uncertainty**
```
Tool Condition: 47%
Problem: Implies false precision
Player doesn't understand remaining lifetime variance
```

**Best: Communicate Uncertainty Explicitly**
```
Tool Condition: 47% (±15%)
Expected Remaining Uses: 23-37 operations
Recommendation: Replace within 10 operations

Benefit: Player understands:
- Current state
- Expected range
- Decision timeframe
- Can plan accordingly
```

**BlueMarble Uncertainty Communication:**
```
Mineral Deposit Assessment Display:

[Visual: Cross-section with colored zones]

Estimated Ore Body:
Volume: 2,400 - 3,800 cubic meters
Confidence: Medium (based on 4 core samples)

Average Grade: 3.2% copper (±1.1%)
Confidence: High (12 assay results)

Depth Range: 12-28 meters below surface
Confidence: High (geophysical survey + drilling)

Rock Hardness: Mohs 6-7 (quartzite host rock)
Confidence: High (field testing + petrology)

Extraction Cost Estimate: $18,000 - $32,000
Confidence: Low (depends on actual conditions)

Expected Revenue: $45,000 - $95,000
Confidence: Medium (grade × volume × current price)

Profitability Assessment: Likely profitable
Risk Level: Moderate
Recommendation: Proceed with mining operation
```

#### Probability vs. Possibility

Costikyan distinguishes between communicating what *can* happen versus what *will likely* happen:

**Possibility Framing (Less Helpful):**
"Tool could fail at any time between 50-150 uses"

**Probability Framing (More Helpful):**
"Tool will most likely fail around 100 uses (68% confidence: 80-120 uses)"

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Ore Grade Reporting:

Possibility Framing:
"Copper grade could range from 1% to 6%"
Problem: Implies uniform probability across range

Probability Framing:
"Copper grade most likely 3-4% (68% confidence: 2.5-4.5%)"
Better: Player understands most probable outcomes

Probabilistic Visualization:
[Graph showing probability distribution]
     │    ╱‾╲
Prob │   ╱   ╲
     │  ╱     ╲___
     │_╱_________╲_
     1  2  3  4  5  6 (% copper)

Best: Visual + numeric probability communication
```

```

### 2. Progressive Uncertainty Reduction

Design player progression as uncertainty management:

```
Novice → Expert Progression:

Week 1-2 (Novice):
- Everything feels uncertain
- Limited information gathering tools
- Poor at interpreting data
- Random-seeming outcomes
- High cognitive load

Uncertainty Profile:
Performative: 80% (poor execution)
Solver's: 90% (don't know patterns)
Analytic: 95% (overwhelmed by variables)
Hidden Info: 100% (no investigation tools)
Randomness: 80% (can't predict distributions)
Semiotic: 90% (unclear UI)

Week 3-6 (Developing):
- Basic patterns recognized

Analytic: 60% (handles typical situations)
Hidden Info: 60% (uses basic tools)
Randomness: 50% (understands distributions)
Semiotic: 30% (fluent with UI)

Week 7-12 (Competent):
- Confident in routine situations
- Efficient information gathering
- Skilled execution
- Good strategic planning
- Uncertainty mainly in complex scenarios

Uncertainty Profile:
Performative: 25% (skilled execution)

Analytic: 20% (handles extreme complexity)
Hidden Info: 15% (optimal investigation)
Randomness: 20% (accurate statistical reasoning)
Semiotic: 5% (complete fluency)
```

### 3. Risk Management Systems

Implement explicit risk/reward decision-making:

```
Risk Assessment Framework:

Conservative Strategy (Low Risk, Low Reward):
- Extensive information gathering before commitment
- Invest in certainty reduction
- Avoid high-variance outcomes
- Stable, predictable progress

Example:
├─ Investigation: 5 days, 6 core samples, full survey
├─ Information Quality: High (uncertainty: 15%)
├─ Committed Resources: $8,000
├─ Expected Return: $45,000 - $52,000 (narrow range)
└─ Risk: LOW

Balanced Strategy (Medium Risk, Medium Reward):
- Moderate information gathering
- Balance investigation cost vs. commitment
- Accept some variance
- Good overall returns

Example:
├─ Investigation: 2 days, 2 core samples, basic survey
├─ Information Quality: Medium (uncertainty: 40%)
├─ Committed Resources: $3,000
├─ Expected Return: $35,000 - $75,000 (wide range)
└─ Risk: MEDIUM

Aggressive Strategy (High Risk, High Reward):
- Minimal information gathering
- Quick commitments
- High variance outcomes
- Potential for big wins or losses

Example:
├─ Investigation: 0.5 days, visual survey only
├─ Information Quality: Low (uncertainty: 70%)
├─ Committed Resources: $1,000
├─ Expected Return: $10,000 - $150,000 (very wide range)
└─ Risk: HIGH

Player Choice:
- Strategy fits different player personalities
- Can mix strategies across situations
- Learn optimal risk level through experience
- No single "correct" approach
```

### 4. Feedback and Learning Systems

Support uncertainty reduction through feedback:

```
Learning System Design:

Outcome Feedback:
├─ Prediction: "Expected 3.5% copper grade"
├─ Reality: "Actual 2.8% copper grade"
├─ Analysis: "Prediction 25% too high"
├─ Reason: "Surface samples showed oxidized copper, not representative of depth"
└─ Lesson: "Surface samples may not represent deep deposits"

Pattern Recognition Support:
├─ Similar Situation Database
├─ "You've seen this geology 4 times before"
├─ "Previous outcomes: 2.9%, 3.1%, 2.7%, 3.3%"
├─ "Current prediction: 3.0% ± 0.3%"
└─ Learning: Pattern familiarity reduces uncertainty

Statistical Literacy Development:
├─ Track prediction vs. reality over time
├─ Show calibration graphs
├─ Highlight systematic biases
├─ Provide accuracy metrics
└─ Goal: Player becomes well-calibrated estimator

Example After 50 Predictions:
[Graph showing prediction accuracy]
Your Calibration Score: 73/100
- When you say "60% confident", you're right 58% of the time ✓
- When you say "90% confident", you're right 71% of the time ✗ (overconfident)
- Advice: Be more cautious with high confidence predictions
```

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Uncertainty Calculations:**

```python
class OptimizedUncertaintySystem:
    def __init__(self):
