### 2. Plugin Architecture

**Technical Implementation:**

RuneLite's plugin system enables community contributions while maintaining security:

```java
// Simplified RuneLite Plugin Structure

@PluginDescriptor(
    name = "Example Plugin",
    description = "Demonstrates plugin architecture",
    tags = {"example", "demo"}
)
public class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
    
    @Inject
    private Client client;  // Access to game client
    
    @Inject
    private OverlayManager overlayManager;  // UI overlay system
    
    @Override
    protected void startUp() {
        // Plugin initialization
        log.info("Example plugin started");
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void shutDown() {
        // Cleanup when disabled
        log.info("Example plugin stopped");
    }
    
    @Subscribe
    public void onGameTick(GameTick event) {
        // Called every game tick (0.6 seconds)
        // Access game state, update overlays
    }
    
    @Subscribe
    public void onMenuOptionClicked(MenuOptionClicked event) {
        // React to player actions
        // Add context menu options
    }
}

// Overlay Example
public class ExampleOverlay extends Overlay {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension render(Graphics2D graphics) {
        // Draw on screen
        graphics.drawString("Plugin Active", 10, 20);
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Plugin Categories:**

```
Core Plugins (Built-in):
- Always available
- Maintained by RuneLite team
- High quality standards
- Core functionality

Plugin Hub (Community):
- User-submitted plugins
- Require approval
- Varied quality
- Experimental features

Sideloaded Plugins (Advanced):
- Local development
- No approval needed
- User responsibility
- Development testing
```

**Security Model:**

```
Plugin Sandboxing:

1. API Limitations:
   - No direct memory access
   - No packet manipulation
   - No file system write (limited)
   - No network requests (restricted)

2. Permission System:
   - Declared permissions required
   - User consent for sensitive operations
   - Audit trail for actions

3. Review Process:
   - Manual code review for Plugin Hub
   - Automated security scanning
   - Community reporting
   - Maintainer updates

4. Isolation:
   - Plugins can't interfere with each other
   - Core client protected
   - Graceful failure handling
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

Design plugin system for scientific tools:

```
BlueMarble Plugin Architecture:

Plugin Types:

Type 1: Visualization Plugins
- Access: Read-only sample data
- Capabilities: Custom charts, 3D models
- Sandboxing: No data modification
- Example: "Advanced Stratigraphy Viewer"

Type 2: Analysis Plugins
- Access: Sample data + metadata
- Capabilities: Statistical analysis, correlations
- Sandboxing: No auto-submission of results
- Example: "Multi-variate Mineral Analyzer"

Type 3: Planning Plugins
- Access: Map data, equipment lists
- Capabilities: Route optimization, resource planning
- Sandboxing: No auto-navigation
- Example: "Expedition Route Optimizer"

Type 4: Social Plugins
- Access: Organization data, player profiles
- Capabilities: Communication, collaboration
- Sandboxing: No automated messaging
- Example: "Research Team Coordinator"

Plugin API Structure:

interface BlueMarblePlugin {
    // Lifecycle
    void initialize();
    void shutdown();
    
    // Data Access
    SampleData[] getSamples(Region region);
    GeologicalData getGeology(Coordinates coords);
    PlayerData getPlayerInfo();
    
    // UI Integration
    Panel createPanel();
    void updateOverlay(Graphics2D g);
    
    // Events
    void onSampleCollected(Sample sample);
    void onAnalysisComplete(Analysis result);
    void onExpeditionStart(Expedition exp);
}

Security Constraints:

1. Read-Only by Default:
   - Plugins cannot modify core game data
   - No direct database access
   - No packet manipulation

2. Explicit Permissions:
   - File system access (logs, exports)
   - Network access (external APIs)
   - Computational resources (heavy analysis)

3. Rate Limiting:
   - API call limits per plugin
   - Resource usage caps
   - Event subscription limits

4. Validation:
   - Input sanitization
   - Output validation
   - Error handling requirements
