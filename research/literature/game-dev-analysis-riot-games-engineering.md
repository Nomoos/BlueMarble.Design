## Part I: Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices vs. Monolith

**Riot's Evolution:**

```
2009: League of Legends Launch
- Monolithic architecture
- Single deployment
- Worked for 1M players

2015: Scaling Crisis
- 67M monthly players
- Monolith couldn't scale
- 3-hour deployments

2018: Microservices Migration
- 100+ microservices
- Independent scaling
- <10 minute deployments
```

**Microservices for MMORPGs:**

| Service | Responsibility | Scaling Factor |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | Login, sessions | 10x concurrent players |
| **Character** | Character data, inventory | 1x total players |
| **World** | Game state, NPCs | 100x per region |
| **Chat** | Player communication | 5x concurrent players |
| **Matchmaking** | Party formation, dungeon queues | 2x concurrent players |
| **Trading** | Marketplace, economy | 1x total players |
| **Leaderboards** | Rankings, achievements | 0.1x total players |

**BlueMarble Service Architecture:**

```
[Load Balancer]
    ├─→ [Auth Service] (High availability)
    ├─→ [Character Service] (Read-heavy, cached)
    ├─→ [World Service Cluster] (CPU-intensive)
    │    ├─ World-Region-1 (Americas)
    │    ├─ World-Region-2 (Europe)
    │    └─ World-Region-3 (Asia)
    ├─→ [Chat Service] (WebSocket, stateful)
    ├─→ [Trading Service] (Transaction-heavy)
    └─→ [Analytics Service] (Event streaming)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Independent Scaling:** Scale World Service without affecting Auth
- **Faster Deploys:** Deploy Chat updates without restarting game servers
- **Resilience:** Auth failure doesn't crash entire game
- **Team Autonomy:** Separate teams own separate services

### 2. Regional Architecture

**Riot's Global Infrastructure:**

```
Regions:
- NA (North America): 3 data centers
- EUW (Europe West): 2 data centers
- EUNE (Europe East): 1 data center
- KR (Korea): 2 data centers
- BR (Brazil): 1 data center
- ... 15+ total regions

Player Routing:
Player → Closest Region → Lowest Latency Server
```

**Latency Targets:**

| Region | Target Latency | P95 Actual | Impact |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------|
| **Same City** | <10ms | 8ms | Competitive play possible |
| **Same Country** | <30ms | 25ms | Smooth gameplay |
| **Same Continent** | <80ms | 65ms | Acceptable |
| **Cross-Continent** | <150ms | 120ms | Noticeable lag |

**BlueMarble Regional Strategy:**

```
Phase 1 (Launch): 3 Regions
- NA-West (Los Angeles)
- EU-Central (Frankfurt)
- APAC (Singapore)

Phase 2 (Year 1): Add 3 Regions
- NA-East (Virginia)
- EU-West (London)
- APAC-East (Tokyo)

Phase 3 (Year 2): Add 4 Regions
- SA (São Paulo)
- OCE (Sydney)
- ME (Dubai)
- SEA (Bangkok)
```

### 3. Data Consistency vs. Availability

**CAP Theorem Applied:**

```
Consistency - Availability - Partition Tolerance
(Pick 2)

Different services, different choices:

Character Data (CP):
- Consistency: Critical (no item duplication)
- Availability: Can wait 100ms
- Choice: Consistent, may be slow

Chat (AP):
- Consistency: Not critical (eventual is OK)
- Availability: Must be fast
- Choice: Available, eventually consistent

World State (CP):
- Consistency: Critical (no teleporting)
- Availability: Critical (gameplay)
- Choice: Partition tolerance sacrificed (single region)
```

**Implementation:**

```python
# Character Service - Strong Consistency
class CharacterService:
    def transfer_item(self, from_player, to_player, item):
        """Atomic transaction with consistency checks"""
        with database.transaction():
            # Lock both players
            from_inv = database.lock_row('inventory', from_player.id)
            to_inv = database.lock_row('inventory', to_player.id)
            
            # Verify source has item
            if item not in from_inv.items:
                raise InvalidTransfer("Item not found")
            
            # Verify destination has space
            if to_inv.is_full():
                raise InvalidTransfer("Inventory full")
            
            # Transfer
            from_inv.items.remove(item)
            to_inv.items.add(item)
            
            # Commit atomically
            database.commit()

# Chat Service - Eventual Consistency
class ChatService:
    def send_message(self, player, channel, message):
        """Fast, eventually consistent"""
        # Store in local cache immediately
        cache.add(channel, message)
        
        # Async replicate to other regions
        async_queue.publish('chat_message', {
            'channel': channel,
            'player': player.id,
            'message': message,
            'timestamp': time.now()
        })
        
        # Return immediately (don't wait for replication)
        return 'OK'
```

## Part II: Deployment and DevOps

### 1. Continuous Deployment

**Riot's Deployment Frequency:**

```
2012: 1 deploy per month
2015: 1 deploy per week
2018: 10+ deploys per day
2023: 50+ deploys per day (across all services)
```

**How They Achieved This:**

1. **Automated Testing:**
   - Unit tests: 10,000+ tests, <5 min
   - Integration tests: 500+ tests, <15 min
   - E2E tests: 50+ tests, <30 min
   - Total: <1 hour gate

2. **Canary Deployments:**
   ```
   1. Deploy to 1% of servers
   2. Monitor for 10 minutes
   3. If metrics OK, deploy to 10%
   4. Monitor for 30 minutes
   5. If metrics OK, deploy to 100%
   6. If issues, rollback automatically
   ```

3. **Feature Flags:**
   ```python
   def new_crafting_system(player):
       if feature_flags.is_enabled('crafting_v2', player):
           return crafting_v2.craft_item(player)
       else:
           return crafting_v1.craft_item(player)
   
   # Enable for 5% of players
   feature_flags.set('crafting_v2', percentage=5)
   
   # Monitor metrics
   if metrics.crafting_v2_success_rate > 0.95:
       # Roll out to 100%
       feature_flags.set('crafting_v2', percentage=100)
   ```

**BlueMarble Deployment Pipeline:**

```
[Commit] → [Unit Tests] → [Build] → [Integration Tests] → 
[Deploy to Staging] → [E2E Tests] → [Deploy to 1% Production] →
[Monitor 10min] → [Deploy to 10%] → [Monitor 30min] → [Deploy to 100%]

Total time: 1-2 hours (automated)
Rollback time: <5 minutes (automated)
```

### 2. Infrastructure as Code

**Riot's Approach:**

```yaml
# Example: Kubernetes deployment for World Service
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: world-service
spec:
  replicas: 100  # Auto-scales based on load
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: world-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: world-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: world-service
        image: bluemarble/world-service:v1.2.3
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "4Gi"
            cpu: "2000m"
          limits:
            memory: "8Gi"
            cpu: "4000m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```

**Auto-Scaling Configuration:**

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: world-service-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: world-service
  minReplicas: 10  # Minimum capacity
  maxReplicas: 500  # Maximum capacity
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70  # Scale at 70% CPU
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: player_count
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "50"  # 50 players per pod
```

### 3. Chaos Engineering

**Riot's Chaos Experiments:**

```
Experiment 1: Kill Random Service
- Randomly terminate 1 service instance every hour
- Verify: System continues operating
- Result: Found 12 services with single points of failure

Experiment 2: Introduce Latency
- Add 500ms delay to 10% of database queries
- Verify: Users don't notice (<1% complaints)
- Result: Identified need for timeouts and retries

Experiment 3: Simulate Regional Failure
- Take down entire EU-West region
- Verify: Players auto-route to EU-Central
- Result: 97% of players successfully migrated
```

**Implementation:**

```python
class ChaosMonkey:
    """Randomly introduce failures to test resilience"""
    
    def __init__(self, failure_rate=0.01):
        self.failure_rate = failure_rate
    
    def maybe_fail(self, operation_name):
        """Randomly fail operations in production"""
        if random.random() < self.failure_rate:
            logger.warning(f"Chaos: Failing {operation_name}")
            raise ChaosException(f"Intentional failure: {operation_name}")
    
    def inject_latency(self, min_ms=100, max_ms=1000):
        """Add random latency"""
        delay = random.randint(min_ms, max_ms)
        time.sleep(delay / 1000.0)

# Usage in service code
chaos = ChaosMonkey(failure_rate=0.001)  # 0.1% failure rate

def get_player_data(player_id):
    chaos.maybe_fail('get_player_data')
    chaos.inject_latency()
    
    # Actual implementation
    return database.query('player', player_id)
```

## Part III: Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics That Matter

**Riot's Core Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Action |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Latency P50** | <30ms | >50ms | Investigate |
| **Latency P95** | <100ms | >200ms | Alert on-call |
| **Latency P99** | <500ms | >1000ms | Page engineers |
| **Error Rate** | <0.1% | >1% | Immediate action |
| **Availability** | 99.9% | <99.5% | War room |
| **Players Affected** | <100 | >1000 | Rollback immediately |

**Monitoring Stack:**

```
Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
Logs: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Traces: Jaeger (distributed tracing)
Alerts: PagerDuty
```

**Example Dashboard:**

```python
# Grafana dashboard configuration
dashboard = {
    'title': 'BlueMarble World Service',
    'panels': [
        {
            'title': 'Request Latency',
            'targets': [
                'histogram_quantile(0.50, world_service_latency_bucket)',
                'histogram_quantile(0.95, world_service_latency_bucket)',
                'histogram_quantile(0.99, world_service_latency_bucket)',
            ],
            'thresholds': [50, 100, 500]
        },
        {
            'title': 'Error Rate',
            'targets': [
                'rate(world_service_errors_total[5m])',
            ],
            'thresholds': [0.001, 0.01]
        },
        {
            'title': 'Active Players',
            'targets': [
                'world_service_active_players',
            ],
        },
        {
            'title': 'CPU Usage',
            'targets': [
                'avg(world_service_cpu_usage)',
            ],
            'thresholds': [70, 90]
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Distributed Tracing

**Example Trace:**

```
Request: Player crafts item
├─ Auth Service (2ms)
│  └─ Verify session token
├─ Character Service (15ms)
│  ├─ Load player inventory (8ms)
│  └─ Check recipe unlocked (7ms)
├─ Crafting Service (50ms)
│  ├─ Validate materials (10ms)
│  ├─ Execute craft (30ms)
│  └─ Add result to inventory (10ms)
└─ Analytics Service (5ms)
   └─ Log crafting event

Total: 72ms (P50 target: <100ms ✓)
```

**Implementation:**

```python
import opentelemetry
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def craft_item(player_id, recipe_id):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("craft_item") as span:
        span.set_attribute("player.id", player_id)
        span.set_attribute("recipe.id", recipe_id)
        
        # Step 1: Verify player
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("verify_player"):
            player = auth_service.verify(player_id)
        
        # Step 2: Check materials
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("check_materials"):
            materials = inventory_service.get_materials(player_id)
            if not has_required_materials(materials, recipe_id):
                span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.ERROR, "Missing materials"))
                raise InsufficientMaterials()
        
        # Step 3: Craft
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("execute_craft"):
            result = crafting_engine.craft(recipe_id, materials)
        
        # Step 4: Give item
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("add_to_inventory"):
            inventory_service.add_item(player_id, result)
        
        span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.OK))
        return result
```

## Part IV: Player Experience Focus

### 1. Player-Centric Metrics

**Traditional Metrics:**
- Server uptime: 99.9%
- Response time: 50ms
- Error rate: 0.1%

**Player-Centric Metrics:**
- **"Can I log in?"** → Login success rate
- **"Is my game smooth?"** → FPS, input lag
- **"Are my friends online?"** → Social features availability
- **"Did I lose progress?"** → Data consistency

**Example: Login Experience**

```python
class LoginExperienceTracker:
    """Track login from player perspective"""
    
    def track_login_attempt(self, player_id):
        start_time = time.time()
        
        try:
            # Step 1: Auth
            auth_time = time.time()
            session = auth_service.authenticate(player_id)
            auth_duration = time.time() - auth_time
            
            # Step 2: Load character
            char_time = time.time()
            character = character_service.load(player_id)
            char_duration = time.time() - char_time
            
            # Step 3: Enter world
            world_time = time.time()
            world_service.enter(player_id, character)
            world_duration = time.time() - world_time
            
            total_duration = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Log player experience
            metrics.record('login_success', {
                'player_id': player_id,
                'total_duration': total_duration,
                'auth_duration': auth_duration,
                'char_duration': char_duration,
                'world_duration': world_duration,
                'status': 'success'
            })
            
            # Alert if slow
            if total_duration > 5.0:  # 5 seconds target
                alerts.warn(f"Slow login for {player_id}: {total_duration}s")
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Log failure from player perspective
            metrics.record('login_failure', {
                'player_id': player_id,
                'duration': time.time() - start_time,
                'error': str(e),
                'status': 'failed'
            })
            
            # Alert on any failure
            alerts.error(f"Login failed for {player_id}: {e}")
            raise
```

### 2. Incident Response

**Riot's Incident Levels:**

| Level | Impact | Response Time | Team Size |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **P0** | >10% players affected | <5 minutes | All hands |
| **P1** | >1% players affected | <15 minutes | 5-10 engineers |
| **P2** | <1% players affected | <1 hour | 2-3 engineers |
| **P3** | No player impact | <4 hours | 1 engineer |

**Incident Response Playbook:**

```
P0 Incident Detected:
1. Auto-page on-call engineer (0 min)
2. Create war room Slack channel (1 min)
3. Assess impact + mitigation (2-5 min)
4. Execute mitigation (rollback, failover, etc.) (5-15 min)
5. Communicate to players (15-30 min)
6. Post-incident review (24-48 hours later)
```
