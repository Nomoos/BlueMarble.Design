## Research Context

### Assignment Background

**Assignment Group 02** focuses on Network Programming for Games with five major focus areas:
1. Authoritative server architecture for MMORPGs
2. **Client prediction and lag compensation** (This Topic)
3. State synchronization strategies
4. Network optimization techniques
5. Scalability patterns for thousands of concurrent players

This research note specifically addresses **Topic 2: Client Prediction and Lag Compensation**.

### Methodology

The research followed Assignment Group 02's standard process:
1. **Source Review** (30% of effort) - Analyzed network programming literature and MMORPG case studies
2. **Analysis** (40% of effort) - Evaluated applicability to BlueMarble's planet-scale simulation
3. **Documentation** (30% of effort) - Synthesized findings into actionable recommendations

## Key Findings

### 1. Client-Side Prediction Fundamentals

**Concept Overview:**

Client-side prediction allows the client to immediately simulate the results of player input without waiting for server confirmation. This creates the illusion of zero latency for local player actions.

**Core Mechanism:**

```
Player Input → Client Predicts Locally → Server Validates → Client Reconciles
     ↓                                          ↓
Shows Result Immediately              Confirms or Corrects
```

**Benefits for BlueMarble MMORPG:**
- **Responsiveness**: Player movement feels instant (0ms perceived latency)
- **Smooth Gameplay**: No waiting for 50-150ms round-trip time
- **Better UX**: Players with high latency still get responsive controls
- **Competitive Viability**: Essential for any player-vs-player interactions

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Prediction errors require visible corrections (rubber-banding)
- Complex game state (geological changes, crafting) harder to predict
- Must prevent client-side cheating through prediction manipulation

### 2. Server Reconciliation Patterns

**Authoritative Server Model:**

For MMORPGs like BlueMarble, the server must always have final authority to prevent cheating:

```cpp
// Client sends input commands, not results
struct PlayerInput {
    uint32_t sequenceNumber;
    uint32_t timestamp;
    Vector3 movementDirection;
    bool actionPressed;
    // NOT position/state - server calculates this
};
```

**Reconciliation Process:**

1. **Client**: Stores unconfirmed inputs with sequence numbers
2. **Server**: Processes inputs, returns authoritative state + sequence
3. **Client**: Compares predicted state with server state
4. **Client**: If mismatch, replay inputs from that sequence forward

**Example for Movement:**

```
Client Timeline:
- Input #100: Move North (predicted: X=10, Y=20)
- Input #101: Move East (predicted: X=11, Y=20)
- Input #102: Move East (predicted: X=12, Y=20)

Server Response:
- Confirmed #100: X=10, Y=20 ✓ Match
- Confirmed #101: X=10.8, Y=20 ✗ Mismatch (collision detected)

Client Reconciliation:
- Reset to X=10.8, Y=20
- Replay Input #102 from corrected position
- New predicted position: X=11.8, Y=20
```

**BlueMarble Application:**
- Player movement in geological terrain with dynamic collisions
- Resource gathering interactions (client predicts, server validates)
- Crafting actions (immediate feedback, server confirms quality/result)
- Combat actions (hit detection server-authoritative)

### 3. Lag Compensation for Fair Combat

**The Problem:**

In MMORPG combat, players have varying latencies (20ms to 300ms). Without lag compensation:
- High-ping players can't hit moving targets
- Low-ping players have unfair advantage
- Frustrating, non-competitive gameplay

**Lag Compensation Solution:**

Server "rewinds" the game state to when the player's action originated:

```
1. Player fires arrow at time T with 100ms latency
2. Server receives at time T+100ms
3. Server rewinds game state to T (enemy position then)
4. Server calculates hit detection at rewound state
5. If hit, apply damage at current time T+100ms
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

**Snapshot History Buffer:**
```cpp
class WorldStateHistory {
    // Store world snapshots at regular intervals
    CircularBuffer<WorldSnapshot> snapshots;
    const float SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL = 0.05f; // 50ms intervals
    const int MAX_SNAPSHOTS = 100; // 5 seconds of history

    WorldSnapshot GetStateAtTime(uint32_t timestamp) {
        // Interpolate between snapshots for accuracy
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Fair combat for all latencies up to 200-300ms
- Enables competitive PvP gameplay
- Players see hits register as expected

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased server memory (5-10 seconds of history per region)
- Complex implementation (rewind/replay mechanics)
- "Around the corner" deaths (player took cover, still got hit)

**BlueMarble Specific Considerations:**
- Geological events may need different compensation rules
- Crafting/gathering might not need lag compensation
- Environmental hazards (lava, rockslides) use current state, not rewound

### 4. Dead Reckoning for Bandwidth Optimization

**Concept:**

Instead of sending position updates every frame, use mathematical prediction to estimate position between updates.

**Linear Dead Reckoning:**

```
Predicted Position = Last Known Position + (Velocity × Time Elapsed)
```

**Advanced Dead Reckoning:**

```cpp
struct EntityState {
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 velocity;
    Vector3 acceleration; // For curved movement
    Quaternion rotation;
    Vector3 angularVelocity;
};

Vector3 PredictPosition(EntityState state, float deltaTime) {
    // Polynomial extrapolation
    return state.position
         + state.velocity * deltaTime
         + 0.5f * state.acceleration * deltaTime * deltaTime;
}
```

**Update Threshold:**

Only send updates when prediction error exceeds threshold:

```cpp
if (ActualPosition.DistanceTo(PredictedPosition) > THRESHOLD) {
    SendPositionUpdate();
}
```

**Bandwidth Savings:**

- **Without Dead Reckoning**: 20 updates/second × 24 bytes = 480 bytes/sec per entity
- **With Dead Reckoning**: 2-3 updates/second × 32 bytes = 64-96 bytes/sec
- **Reduction**: 80-85% less bandwidth

**BlueMarble Application:**
- Players moving in straight lines: Very effective (90% reduction)
- Players in combat (frequent direction changes): Moderate (50% reduction)
- NPC wildlife with simple AI: Extremely effective (95% reduction)
- Geological events (slow-moving): Update once per 5-10 seconds

### 5. Interpolation vs. Extrapolation

**Interpolation (Recommended for Remote Entities):**

Display entities slightly in the past, interpolating between known states:

```
Server sends updates at T=0ms, T=100ms, T=200ms
Client displays interpolated state between T=0 and T=100 while receiving T=200
Result: Smooth movement, always accurate, 100ms behind "real" position
```

**Benefits:**
- Always smooth (interpolating between known good states)
- No rubber-banding for remote entities
- More accurate than extrapolation

**Trade-off:**
- Remote entities appear 100-200ms in the past
- Acceptable for non-local entities in MMORPG

**Extrapolation (For Local Player):**

Predict forward from last known state:

```
Last update at T=0ms
Extrapolate to T=50ms using velocity/acceleration
May need correction when next update arrives
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero latency for local player
- Immediate responsiveness

**Trade-offs:**
- Prediction errors require corrections
- Can cause rubber-banding if predictions wrong

**BlueMarble Strategy:**
- **Local Player**: Extrapolation (client prediction)
- **Remote Players**: Interpolation (100-150ms buffer)
- **NPCs/Mobs**: Interpolation (100-150ms buffer)
- **Geological Events**: Interpolation (no need for instant feedback)

### 6. Input Buffering and Timing

**Challenge:**

Network jitter causes variable latency (e.g., 50ms to 150ms spikes).

**Solution - Input Buffer:**

```cpp
class InputBuffer {
    Queue<PlayerInput> inputs;
    const float BUFFER_TIME = 0.1f; // 100ms buffer

    void AddInput(PlayerInput input) {
        input.targetTime = CurrentTime() + BUFFER_TIME;
        inputs.Enqueue(input);
    }

    PlayerInput GetInputForTime(float gameTime) {
        // Returns input scheduled for this time
        // Smooths out jitter
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Absorbs network jitter up to buffer size
- Smooth input processing on server
- Prevents hitching from latency spikes

**Trade-off:**
- Adds constant 100ms latency to all inputs
- Must tune buffer size per game type (fast-paced vs. strategic)

**BlueMarble Tuning:**
- **Combat**: Smaller buffer (50ms) for responsiveness
- **Crafting/Building**: Larger buffer (200ms) for smoothness
- **Movement**: Medium buffer (100ms) balances both

### 7. Prediction Error Correction

**Smoothing Corrections:**

When server correction needed, don't snap instantly:

```cpp
class EntityPosition {
    Vector3 displayPosition;  // What player sees
    Vector3 correctPosition;  // Server-authoritative

    void Update(float deltaTime) {
        // Smooth correction over multiple frames
        const float CORRECTION_SPEED = 10.0f; // Units per second

        Vector3 error = correctPosition - displayPosition;
        float maxCorrection = CORRECTION_SPEED * deltaTime;

        if (error.Length() > maxCorrection) {
            displayPosition += error.Normalized() * maxCorrection;
        } else {
            displayPosition = correctPosition;
        }
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Less jarring than instant snapping
- Maintains gameplay feel
- Errors under threshold barely noticeable

**BlueMarble Application:**
- Small position errors (<0.5m): Smooth over 0.2 seconds
- Medium errors (0.5-2m): Smooth over 0.1 seconds
- Large errors (>2m): Instant snap (likely desync or teleport)

        while (!pendingInputs.Empty() &&
               pendingInputs.Front().sequenceNum <= state.lastProcessedInput) {
            pendingInputs.Dequeue();
        }

        // Check for mismatch
        float error = (serverPosition - state.position).Length();
        if (error > 0.1f) {

    bool ProcessHitscanAttack(Player attacker, Ray attackRay) {
        // Calculate when attack originated on client
        uint32_t attackTime = CurrentTime() - attacker.averageLatency;

        // Get world state from that time
        WorldSnapshot historicalState = history.GetStateAt(attackTime);

        // Perform hit detection in historical state
        for (auto& entity : historicalState.entities) {
            if (attackRay.Intersects(entity.bounds)) {
                // Hit! Apply damage in current time
                ApplyDamage(entity.id, attackDamage);
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false; // Miss
    }

    void StoreSnapshot() {
        WorldSnapshot snapshot;
        snapshot.timestamp = CurrentTime();

        // Copy all entity positions/states
        for (auto& entity : activeEntities) {
            snapshot.entities.push_back(entity.GetState());
        }

        history.PushBack(snapshot);

        // Keep 5 seconds of history
