## Part I: Core Community Knowledge Areas

### 1. MMORPG Architecture Patterns

**Recurring Discussion Themes:**

The r/gamedev community frequently discusses MMORPG architecture challenges, with consensus emerging around several key patterns:

**Server Architecture Models:**

**Monolithic vs. Microservices Debate:**
```
Community Consensus (from 50+ discussion threads):
- Start Monolithic: For teams under 10 people, begin with monolithic architecture
- Split Early: Identify natural boundaries (auth, world, chat, economy) from day one
- Microservices When: Split when team > 15 or specific bottlenecks emerge
- Don't Premature: Avoid microservices complexity without clear scalability needs
```

**Authoritative Server Pattern (Unanimous):**
- Never trust client: All game logic runs server-side
- Client is "dumb terminal": Renders and sends inputs only
- Validation: Double-check all player actions on server
- Anti-cheat: Server validates movement speed, resource gathering rates, combat calculations

**Interest Management for MMORPGs:**

Community recommends spatial partitioning approaches:
```
Popular Approaches (ranked by community preference):
1. Grid-Based (75% recommend): Divide world into cells, track entities per cell
2. Quad/Octree (15% recommend): Dynamic spatial subdivision
3. R-Tree (5% recommend): For complex geographic queries
4. Hybrid (5% recommend): Grid for fast lookups + R-Tree for complex shapes
```

**BlueMarble Application:**
Given BlueMarble's planet-scale geography, grid-based approach with geographic cells (e.g., 10km x 10km tiles) aligns with community best practices. PostGIS can handle complex geographic queries while grid provides fast entity lookups.

---

### 2. Networking Strategies for Persistent Worlds

**Latency Compensation Techniques:**

Community identifies three essential techniques for MMORPGs:

**Client-Side Prediction:**
```
What it solves: Removes input lag feeling
How it works: Client simulates movement immediately, server corrects if wrong
Community warning: "Only predict deterministic actions (movement, not combat)"
```

**Server Reconciliation:**
```
What it solves: Smoothly corrects client predictions
How it works: Server sends authoritative state, client interpolates correction
Community tip: "Use exponential smoothing, never snap instantly"
```

**Entity Interpolation:**
```
What it solves: Smooth movement for other players despite packet loss
How it works: Interpolate between last two known positions
Community standard: "Always render ~100ms in the past for smooth interpolation"
```

**State Synchronization Patterns:**

Community consensus on update frequencies:
```
Recommended Update Rates (from r/gamedev surveys):
- Player positions: 10-20 Hz (50-100ms intervals)
- Combat actions: 30-60 Hz during combat (16-33ms intervals)
- World state (geology, weather): 1 Hz (1000ms intervals)
- Chat/social: On-demand (no polling)
- Inventory: On-change only (RPC-style)
```

**Network Protocol Choices:**

Community recommendations for different game systems:
```
TCP for:
- Player authentication
- Inventory transactions
- Chat messages
- Database sync

UDP for:
- Player movement
- Combat actions
- Real-time position updates

WebSocket for:
- Browser-based clients
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Simpler deployment
```

**Community Warning (appears in 100+ threads):**
"Don't roll your own networking library. Use proven solutions: ENet, RakNet, or engine-built-in."

---

### 3. Database Design for Persistent Worlds

**Schema Design Patterns:**

The community strongly advocates for separation of concerns:

**Player Data (High Consistency):**
```sql
Community-recommended approach:
- Use ACID-compliant database (PostgreSQL preferred 3:1 over MySQL)
- Transactions for inventory operations
- Foreign keys for referential integrity
- Regular backups (every 15 minutes recommended)
```

**World State (Eventual Consistency Acceptable):**
```
Community pattern:
- Cache in-memory (Redis/Memcached)
- Periodic persistence to disk
- Accept 5-10 second data loss on crash for world state
- Players expect world state to be "close enough"
```

**Time-Series Data (Specialized Storage):**
```
For geological simulation, weather patterns:
Community recommends: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or custom time-series storage
Rationale: Standard SQL databases struggle with high-frequency writes
```

**Sharding Strategies:**

Community consensus on when and how to shard:
```
When to Shard (Community Signals):
- > 1000 concurrent players per server
- > 500GB database size
- Query latency > 100ms p95
- Write contention on hot tables

How to Shard:
1. Geographic (most popular): Shard by world region
2. Feature-based: Separate systems (accounts, world, economy)
3. Player-based (least popular): Hash by player ID
```

**Backup Strategies (from postmortems):**

Critical lessons from failed launches:
```
Minimum Requirements (learned the hard way):
1. Real-time replication to secondary
2. 15-minute incremental backups
3. Daily full backups retained for 30 days
4. Test restore procedure monthly
5. Off-site backup storage

Disaster Recovery Priority:
- Player accounts: Critical (restore within 1 hour)
- Inventory: Critical (restore within 1 hour)
- World state: Medium (can rebuild from last known state)
- Chat logs: Low (can lose without major impact)
```

---

### 4. Performance Optimization Patterns

**Profiling-Driven Optimization:**

Community mantra: "Profile first, optimize second. Never guess."

**Recommended Profiling Tools:**
```
Server-Side (C++/Rust):
- Valgrind + Callgrind (CPU profiling)
- Heaptrack (memory profiling)
- perf (Linux performance analysis)
- Custom metrics: Prometheus + Grafana

Database:
- pg_stat_statements (PostgreSQL)
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE (query planning)
- pt-query-digest (MySQL)

Network:
- Wireshark (packet analysis)
- Custom latency histograms
```

**Common MMORPG Bottlenecks (from community postmortems):**

**Bottleneck #1: Spatial Queries (40% of performance issues)**
```
Problem: Finding nearby entities every frame
Bad approach: SELECT * FROM entities WHERE distance < radius
Good approach: Grid-based spatial index in memory

Performance impact:
- Bad: 50ms for 10k entities
- Good: 0.5ms for 10k entities (100x improvement)
```

**Bottleneck #2: Database Transactions (30% of issues)**
```
Problem: Blocking on database writes
Bad approach: Synchronous writes on every action
Good approach: Batch updates, write-behind cache

Performance impact:
- Bad: 500 actions/sec
- Good: 50,000 actions/sec (100x improvement)
```

**Bottleneck #3: Network Bandwidth (20% of issues)**
```
Problem: Sending too much data per update
Bad approach: Full entity state every frame
Good approach: Delta compression, interest management

Bandwidth reduction:
- Bad: 10 MB/sec per player
- Good: 100 KB/sec per player (100x reduction)
```

**Bottleneck #4: Memory Leaks (10% of issues)**
```
Problem: Long-running server accumulates memory
Community solution: Regular server restarts + leak detection
Prevention: RAII patterns, smart pointers, memory profiling
```

---

### 5. Anti-Cheat and Security

**Server-Side Validation (Non-Negotiable):**

Community consensus: "Assume every client is compromised."

**Essential Validations:**
```cpp
// Movement validation
bool ValidateMovement(Player* player, Vector2 newPos) {
    float distance = (newPos - player->oldPos).Length();
    float maxDistance = player->speed * deltaTime * 1.1; // 10% tolerance
    
    if (distance > maxDistance) {
        LogCheatAttempt(player, "Speed hack detected");
        return false;
    }
    
    if (IsPositionInWall(newPos)) {
        LogCheatAttempt(player, "Wall clipping attempt");
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Resource gathering validation
bool ValidateResourceGather(Player* player, Resource* resource) {
    float distance = (player->pos - resource->pos).Length();
    if (distance > GATHER_RANGE) {
        LogCheatAttempt(player, "Teleport gathering");
        return false;
    }
    
    if (player->lastGatherTime + MIN_GATHER_INTERVAL > currentTime) {
        LogCheatAttempt(player, "Too fast gathering");
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**

Community-recommended limits:
```
Action Type -> Max Rate per Second:
- Movement updates: 20-30 updates/sec
- Chat messages: 2-5 messages/sec
- Item transactions: 10 transactions/sec
- API calls: 100 requests/sec

Punishment escalation:
1st violation: Warning
2nd violation: 5-minute timeout
3rd violation: 1-hour ban
4th violation: Permanent ban + investigation
```

**Encryption and Authentication:**

```
Minimum Security Requirements (community consensus):
1. TLS 1.3 for all client-server communication
2. Password hashing: Argon2id or bcrypt (never MD5/SHA1)
3. Session tokens: 256-bit random, rotate every 24 hours
4. Two-factor authentication: Optional but recommended
5. Rate limit login attempts: 5 tries per 15 minutes
```

## Part II: BlueMarble-Specific Applications

### 1. Geological Simulation Architecture

**Applying Community Patterns to BlueMarble:**

Given BlueMarble's focus on realistic geological simulation, we can apply r/gamedev patterns:

**Simulation Ticking Strategy:**
```
Community Pattern: Variable tick rates for different systems
BlueMarble Application:

High Frequency (60 Hz):
- Player movement and combat
- Real-time weather effects
- Active mining/drilling operations

Medium Frequency (10 Hz):
- Geological stress calculations
- Resource regeneration
- NPC pathfinding

Low Frequency (1 Hz):
- Long-term geological changes
- Climate patterns
- Economic simulation

Very Low Frequency (0.1 Hz - every 10 seconds):
- Continental drift simulation
- Deep earth processes
- Global resource distribution
```

**Memory Management for Geological Data:**

Community recommendation: "Don't keep everything in memory."

```
BlueMarble Strategy:
- Active Regions: Full geological data in memory (10km radius around players)
- Nearby Regions: Cached summary data (100km radius)
- Distant Regions: Database only, load on demand
- Historical Data: Time-series database, query when needed

Estimated Memory Usage:
- Active: 10 MB per 10km x 10km tile (100 players = 1 GB)
- Nearby: 1 MB per tile (cached)
- Distant: 0 bytes (database only)
```

---

### 2. Player Economy and Trading

**Community Lessons from MMORPG Economies:**

Common economic failures discussed on r/gamedev:

**Inflation Problems:**
```
Problem: Resource generation > resource sinks
Community solutions:
1. Durability/repair costs (equipment degrades)
2. Consumables (potions, food, ammunition)
3. Taxes on transactions (5-10% market tax)
4. Prestige items (cosmetic sinks for wealthy players)
5. Territory maintenance costs

BlueMarble Application:
- Geological resources regenerate slowly (weeks/months)
- Equipment requires rare materials for maintenance
- Market transaction fees (5% to global economy)
- Claim maintenance costs (pay to keep mining rights)
```

**Market Manipulation Prevention:**
```
Problem: Players corner markets, exploit bugs
Community solutions:
1. Price ceilings/floors (prevent extreme manipulation)
2. Transaction limits (max 100 trades per day)
3. Market monitoring (flag suspicious patterns)
4. Delayed order execution (prevent instant arbitrage)

BlueMarble Application:
- Automated market maker for basic resources
- Progressive taxes on large transactions
- Public transaction history (transparency)
- Geographic markets (regional price differences)
```

---

### 3. Content Generation and World Building

**Procedural Generation Patterns:**

Community consensus on procedural worlds:

**Hybrid Approach (Most Successful):**
```
Procedural generation for: Scale and variation
Hand-crafted content for: Quality and storytelling

BlueMarble Application:
- Procedural: Terrain, geology, resource distribution (99% of planet)
- Hand-crafted: Starting areas, tutorial zones, major landmarks (1% of planet)
- Algorithmic: Biomes, climate zones based on latitude/altitude
- Player-driven: Building, terraforming, environmental changes
```

**Seeded Generation (Consistency Requirement):**
```
Community requirement: Same seed = same world

BlueMarble Implementation:
- Global seed: Determines planet-wide geology
- Regional seeds: Derived from global seed + geographic coordinates
- Chunk generation: Deterministic from region seed
- Benefit: Generate on-demand, regenerate if lost, same on all servers
```

**Quality Control for Procedural Content:**
```
Community-tested validation:
1. Playability tests: Can players reach all areas?
2. Resource distribution: Are resources balanced?
3. Visual coherence: Does terrain look natural?
4. Performance tests: Does generation lag servers?

BlueMarble Validation Pipeline:
- Automated tests: Check accessibility, resource balance
- Manual spot-checks: Review random samples
- Player feedback: Flag broken/ugly areas for regeneration
- Iterative refinement: Adjust generation algorithms based on data
```

- Fast execution (< 1ms per test)
- Mock external dependencies
- Run on every commit

Integration Tests (20% of tests):
- Test system interactions
- Database, networking, file I/O
- Slower execution (10-100ms per test)
- Run before merging to develop

End-to-End Tests (10% of tests):
- Test full player workflows
- Spawn real servers and clients
- Slowest execution (1-10 seconds per test)
- Run nightly and before releases

Load Tests (Continuous):
- Simulate 1000+ concurrent players
- Run in staging environment
- Measure performance degradation
- Identify bottlenecks before launch
```

**Chaos Engineering (for Robustness):**

```
Community practice: "Break things in test to prevent breaking in production."

Mistake: Optimizing before identifying bottlenecks
Community lesson: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order."

How to Avoid:
1. Build working prototype first
2. Profile to find actual bottlenecks
3. Optimize only hot paths (80/20 rule)
4. Measure impact of optimizations
```

**Pitfall #2: Feature Creep**
```
Mistake: Adding features indefinitely, never shipping
Community lesson: "Minimum viable product first, then iterate."

How to Avoid:
1. Define core features (must-have)
2. Create feature roadmap (nice-to-have)
3. Ship early, ship often
4. Let player feedback guide development
```

**Pitfall #3: Ignoring Technical Debt**
```
Mistake: "We'll fix it later" - later never comes
Community lesson: "Technical debt compounds interest."

How to Avoid:
1. Allocate 20% time for refactoring
2. Fix broken windows immediately
3. Pay down debt before adding features
4. Maintain code quality standards
```

**Pitfall #4: Insufficient Load Testing**
```
Mistake: Testing with 10 players, launching to 10,000
Community lesson: "Load test at 10x expected capacity."

How to Avoid:
1. Automated load testing in CI/CD
2. Stress test every major release
3. Monitor production metrics continuously
4. Plan for 10x growth
```

**Pitfall #5: Poor Communication**
```
Mistake: Surprise updates breaking player expectations
Community lesson: "Under-promise, over-deliver."

How to Avoid:
1. Publish roadmap early
2. Communicate changes in advance
