   - Mitigation: Built-in buffer in effort estimates
   - Contingency: Groups 27-38 reserved for overflow

2. **Source Availability**
   - Mitigation: Verify access before assignment
   - Contingency: Substitute sources prepared

3. **Quality Variance**
   - Mitigation: Clear standards and templates
   - Contingency: Peer review process

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict source count per group
   - Contingency: Move extras to Phase 3

5. **Parallel Conflicts**
