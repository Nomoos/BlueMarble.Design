## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Mitigation: Built-in buffer in effort estimates
   - Contingency: Groups 27-38 reserved for overflow

2. **Source Availability**
   - Mitigation: Verify access before assignment
   - Contingency: Substitute sources prepared

3. **Quality Variance**
   - Mitigation: Clear standards and templates
   - Contingency: Peer review process

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict source count per group
   - Contingency: Move extras to Phase 3

5. **Parallel Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Isolated assignment files
   - Contingency: Merge conflict resolution plan

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule:**
- Prioritize Critical and High sources only
- Move Medium/Low to Phase 3
- Reduce document length targets
- Focus on implementation guidance

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Process additional discovered sources
- Enhance document depth and quality
- Create supplementary materials
- Begin Phase 3 planning early

## Lessons Learned from Phase 1

### What Worked Well

1. **Parallel Group Structure**
   - Enabled 40 concurrent work streams
   - Prevented merge conflicts
   - Maintained quality across groups

2. **Quality Standards**
   - YAML front matter ensured consistency
   - Minimum line counts ensured depth
   - Code examples ensured practical value

3. **Discovered Source Tracking**
   - Captured valuable follow-on research
   - Enabled systematic Phase 2 planning

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Timeline Estimation**
   - Phase 1 took 4 months vs 2-3 estimated
   - Factor: Research depth exceeded expectations
   - Solution: More realistic estimates for Phase 2

2. **Discovery Processing**
   - Discovered source queue grew faster than processed
   - Factor: New sources found faster than capacity
   - Solution: Dedicated processing capacity in Phase 2

3. **Scope Management**
   - Some documents exceeded 2000 lines
   - Factor: Comprehensive coverage desired
   - Solution: Clearer scope boundaries for Phase 2

### Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **Time-Box Research**
   - Enforce maximum document lengths
   - Set clear scope boundaries
   - Stop when diminishing returns reached

2. **Continuous Discovery Processing**
   - Don't let queue build up
   - Process discoveries within 1 week
   - Reserve groups 27-38 for this purpose

3. **Weekly Check-Ins**
   - Monitor progress and blockers
   - Adjust assignments as needed
   - Share key findings across groups

4. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Focus on implementation-ready content
   - Prioritize code examples
   - Ensure BlueMarble applicability
