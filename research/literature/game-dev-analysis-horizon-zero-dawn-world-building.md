## Part I: Terrain Generation Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Terrain System

**Architecture Overview:**

Horizon Zero Dawn uses a sophisticated multi-layer approach to terrain generation that combines:

```
Terrain Layer Stack:
1. Base Heightmap Layer
   - Large-scale geographical features
   - Generated from real-world elevation data
   - Resolution: 512m per tile
   
2. Detail Heightmap Layer
   - Medium-scale features (hills, valleys)
   - Procedurally generated with artist control
   - Resolution: 128m per tile
   
3. Splat Map Layer
   - Material/texture distribution
   - Biome definitions
   - Multiple channels for blending
   
4. Vegetation Layer
   - Instance placement data
   - Density and variety information
   - LOD transition markers
   
5. Detail Object Layer
   - Rocks, debris, small features
   - Procedural scatter with rules
   - Artist-placeable overrides
```

**Implementation Pattern:**

```csharp
public class HZDTerrainSystem
{
    public class TerrainTile
    {
        public Texture2D baseHeightmap;      // 2048x2048
        public Texture2D detailHeightmap;    // 2048x2048
        public Texture2D splatMap;           // 2048x2048, RGBA channels
        public VegetationData vegetation;
        public DetailObjectData details;
        
        public Vector2 worldPosition;
        public float tileSize = 512f; // meters
    }
    
    public float GetTerrainHeight(Vector3 worldPos)
    {
        TerrainTile tile = GetTileAtPosition(worldPos);
        Vector2 localPos = worldPos.xz - tile.worldPosition;
        Vector2 uv = localPos / tile.tileSize;
        
        // Sample base heightmap
        float baseHeight = SampleTexture(tile.baseHeightmap, uv) * 2000f;
        
        // Add detail heightmap
        float detailHeight = SampleTexture(tile.detailHeightmap, uv) * 500f;
        
        return baseHeight + detailHeight;
    }
}
```

### 2. Biome System Architecture

**Seven Distinct Biomes:**

1. **Lush Forests** - Dense vegetation, rich greens
2. **Snowy Mountains** - Alpine terrain, sparse vegetation
3. **Desert Mesas** - Arid, rocky formations
4. **Tropical Jungles** - Extreme vegetation density
5. **Grasslands** - Rolling plains, scattered trees
6. **Wetlands** - Water features, aquatic plants
7. **Volcanic** - Barren, dramatic geology

**Biome Blending System:**

```csharp
public class BiomeBlender
{
    public struct BiomeWeight
    {
        public BiomeType type;
        public float weight;
        public Vector3 centerPosition;
        public float radius;
    }
    
    public BiomeData BlendBiomes(Vector3 worldPos, List<BiomeWeight> nearbyBiomes)
    {
        BiomeData result = new BiomeData();
        float totalWeight = 0f;
        
        foreach(var biome in nearbyBiomes)
        {
            float distance = Vector3.Distance(worldPos, biome.centerPosition);
            float falloff = 1f - Mathf.Clamp01(distance / biome.radius);
            
            // Smooth falloff curve
            falloff = Mathf.SmoothStep(0f, 1f, falloff);
            
            float weight = biome.weight * falloff;
            totalWeight += weight;
            
            // Blend parameters
            result.vegetationDensity += biome.type.vegetationDensity * weight;
            result.rockDensity += biome.type.rockDensity * weight;
            result.colorTint += biome.type.colorTint * weight;
        }
        
        // Normalize
        if(totalWeight > 0f)
        {
            result.vegetationDensity /= totalWeight;
            result.rockDensity /= totalWeight;
            result.colorTint /= totalWeight;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Transition Zones:**

- Smooth gradients between biomes (typically 200-500m)
- Vegetation mixing based on proximity
- Terrain features blend naturally
- Material textures crossfade

## Part II: Procedural Vegetation System

### 3. Vegetation Placement Rules

**Ecological Simulation:**

Guerrilla Games implemented rule-based vegetation placement that considers:

```python
class VegetationPlacement:
    def can_place_vegetation(self, position, plant_type):
        """
        Determines if vegetation can be placed at position
        """
        rules = plant_type.placement_rules
        
        # Check terrain slope
        slope = get_terrain_slope(position)
        if slope < rules.min_slope or slope > rules.max_slope:
            return False
        
        # Check elevation
        elevation = get_terrain_elevation(position)
        if elevation < rules.min_elevation or elevation > rules.max_elevation:
            return False
        
        # Check distance from water
        water_dist = get_distance_to_water(position)
        if water_dist < rules.min_water_distance:
            return False
        
        # Check biome compatibility
        biome = get_biome_at_position(position)
        if biome not in rules.compatible_biomes:
            return False
        
        # Check proximity to other vegetation (avoid clustering)
        nearby_plants = query_nearby_vegetation(position, rules.min_spacing)
        if len(nearby_plants) >= rules.max_neighbors:
            return False
        
        # Probabilistic placement based on density map
        density = get_vegetation_density(position, biome)
        if random.random() > density:
            return False
        
        return True
```

**Placement Strategy:**

```
Vegetation Placement Pipeline:

1. Generate Density Map
   - Based on biome
   - Influenced by terrain features
   - Artist-painted overrides
   
2. Scatter Placement Points
   - Poisson disk sampling for even distribution
   - Density-weighted random selection
   - Multiple passes for different plant types
   
3. Rule Validation
   - Check ecological constraints
   - Verify terrain suitability
   - Avoid invalid placements
   
4. Variation Selection
   - Random selection from plant variants
   - Scale randomization (80-120%)
   - Rotation randomization
   
5. LOD Assignment
   - Distance-based LOD levels
   - Impostor billboards for far distance
   - Culling groups for optimization
```

### 4. Vegetation Types and Varieties

**Asset Library:**

- **Trees:** 50+ species with 5-10 variants each
- **Bushes:** 30+ types with seasonal variations
- **Grass:** 20+ grass types, procedurally placed
- **Flowers:** 15+ species in clusters
- **Rocks:** Counted as "vegetation" in placement system

**LOD Strategy:**

```
LOD Levels:
- LOD0 (0-30m): Full detail mesh, all materials
- LOD1 (30-100m): Reduced mesh, simplified materials
- LOD2 (100-300m): Simple mesh, single material
- LOD3 (300-1000m): Impostor billboard (2 polygons)
- LOD4 (1000m+): Culled entirely
```

```

### 6. Procedural vs. Artist Control Balance

**Guerrilla's Approach:**

```
Control Spectrum:

Fully Procedural:
- Grass placement
- Small rock scatter
- Terrain micro-details
- Background vegetation

Hybrid (Procedural + Artist):
- Tree placement
- Bush distribution
- Large rock formations
- Terrain sculpting

Fully Manual:
- Hero assets
- Quest locations
- Climbing paths
- Player traversal routes
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

```csharp
public class BlueMarbleWorldBuilder
{
    public enum ControlLevel
    {
        FullyProcedural,    // Algorithm decides everything
        ProcedGuided,       // Algorithm with artist constraints
        ArtistGuided,       // Artist with procedural assist
        FullyManual         // Complete artist control
    }
    
    public class RegionDefinition
    {
        public BiomeType biome;
        public ControlLevel terrainControl;
        public ControlLevel vegetationControl;
        public float importanceScore; // 0-1, affects detail budget
        
        public bool allowProceduralGeneration;
        public List<PlacementRule> rules;
        public Texture2D artistHeightmap;  // Optional override
        public Texture2D vegetationDensityOverride;
    }
    
    public void GenerateRegion(RegionDefinition region)
    {
        // Terrain generation
        if(region.terrainControl == ControlLevel.FullyProcedural)
        {
            GenerateProceduralTerrain(region);
        }
        else if(region.terrainControl == ControlLevel.ProcedGuided)
        {
            GenerateProceduralTerrain(region);
            ApplyArtistConstraints(region.artistHeightmap);
        }
        else
        {
            ImportArtistTerrain(region.artistHeightmap);
        }
        
        // Vegetation placement
        PlaceVegetation(region);
        
        // Detail objects
        PlaceDetailObjects(region);
    }
}
```

## Part IV: Performance and Streaming

### 7. Streaming Architecture

**Tile-Based Streaming:**

```
Streaming System:

World divided into 512m x 512m tiles
Each tile contains:
- Heightmap data (4MB)
- Vegetation instance data (2-10MB)
- Detail object data (1-3MB)
- Material/texture references (1MB)

Total per tile: 8-18MB

Streaming Strategy:
- Load ring around player (5x5 tiles = 25 tiles)
- Preload in movement direction (3 tiles)
- Unload tiles >2km away
- Priority system for critical tiles

Memory Budget:
- Loaded tiles: 400-450MB
- Texture streaming: 200-300MB
- Geometry streaming: 100-150MB
Total: ~700-900MB for world content
```

**LOD Transitions:**

```csharp
public class HZDLODManager
{
    public struct LODLevel
    {
        public float startDistance;
        public float endDistance;
        public int meshLOD;
        public int textureLOD;
        public bool castShadows;
    }
    
    public static readonly LODLevel[] VegetationLODs = new LODLevel[]
    {
        new LODLevel { startDistance = 0f,    endDistance = 30f,   meshLOD = 0, textureLOD = 0, castShadows = true },
        new LODLevel { startDistance = 30f,   endDistance = 100f,  meshLOD = 1, textureLOD = 1, castShadows = true },
        new LODLevel { startDistance = 100f,  endDistance = 300f,  meshLOD = 2, textureLOD = 2, castShadows = false },
        new LODLevel { startDistance = 300f,  endDistance = 1000f, meshLOD = 3, textureLOD = 3, castShadows = false },
    };
    
    public int GetLODLevel(float distance)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < VegetationLODs.Length; i++)
        {
            if(distance >= VegetationLODs[i].startDistance &&
               distance < VegetationLODs[i].endDistance)
            {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return VegetationLODs.Length; // Culled
    }
}
```

## Part V: BlueMarble Implementation Strategy

### 9. Adapted World Building Pipeline

**Phase 1: Planet-Scale Generation**

```python
class BlueMarbleworldGenerator:
    def generate_planet(self):
        """
        Initial planet-scale generation
        """
        # 1. Generate tectonic plates
        plates = generate_tectonic_plates(num_plates=12)
        
        # 2. Simulate plate tectonics
        elevation = simulate_plate_movement(plates, years=100_000_000)
        
        # 3. Generate climate zones
        climate = calculate_climate_zones(elevation)
        
        # 4. Assign biomes based on climate + elevation
        biomes = assign_biomes(elevation, climate)
        
        # 5. Generate base heightmap (low-res, entire planet)
        heightmap = generate_base_heightmap(elevation, resolution=4096)
        
        return PlanetData(plates, elevation, climate, biomes, heightmap)
```

**Phase 2: Regional Detail Generation**

```csharp
public class RegionalGenerator
{
    public void GenerateRegion(Vector2 regionCoords, BiomeType biome)
    {
        // Generate high-res heightmap for region (10km x 10km)
        Texture2D heightmap = GenerateDetailedHeightmap(regionCoords, biome);
        
        // Apply erosion simulation
        SimulateErosion(heightmap, iterations: 100);
        
        // Generate vegetation placement
        VegetationData vegetation = PlaceVegetation(heightmap, biome);
        
        // Add detail objects
        DetailObjectData details = PlaceDetailObjects(heightmap, biome);
        
        // Save to disk for streaming
        SaveRegionData(regionCoords, heightmap, vegetation, details);
    }
}
```
