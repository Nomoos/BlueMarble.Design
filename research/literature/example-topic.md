## Example: Database Architecture Patterns

### Topic Context

**Source Materials:**
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
- "Database Internals" by Alex Petrov
- "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman
- PostgreSQL and MySQL official documentation
- Academic papers on distributed systems

**Research Question:**
How should BlueMarble structure its database architecture to support planet-scale geological simulation with thousands of concurrent players?

### Key Findings

#### 1. Scalability Patterns

**Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling:**

Modern MMORPGs require horizontal scaling due to:
- Player count exceeding single-server capacity
- Geographic distribution for latency reduction
- Fault tolerance and redundancy needs
- Cost optimization through commodity hardware

**Sharding Strategies:**

Database sharding divides data across multiple nodes:
- **Geographic Sharding**: Partition by world regions
- **Player-Based Sharding**: Partition by player ID ranges
- **Feature-Based Sharding**: Separate systems (inventory, world state, chat)

**Example Pattern:**
```
World Database Cluster:
├── Shard 1: Europe Region (Lat/Lon bounds)
├── Shard 2: North America Region
├── Shard 3: Asia Region
└── Shard 4: Global Lookup Tables
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Linear scalability with hardware
- Pro: Regional latency optimization
- Con: Cross-shard queries expensive
- Con: Rebalancing complexity

#### 2. Data Consistency Models

**CAP Theorem Application:**

Distributed systems must choose between:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see same data
- **Availability**: Every request receives response
- **Partition Tolerance**: System functions despite network failures

**MMORPG-Specific Considerations:**

Different game systems have different consistency needs:

**High Consistency (CP Systems):**
- Player inventory transactions
- Currency/economy operations
- Critical state changes (death, level up)
- Use: ACID transactions, strong consistency

**High Availability (AP Systems):**
- Chat messages
- World exploration updates
- Non-critical telemetry
- Use: Eventual consistency, conflict resolution

**Example Implementation:**
```
Inventory System → PostgreSQL (ACID transactions)
Chat System → Redis Pub/Sub (eventual consistency)
World State → Custom event-sourced system (hybrid)
```

#### 3. Event Sourcing Patterns

**Concept:**
Store all changes as immutable event log rather than current state only.

**Benefits for MMORPGs:**
- Complete audit trail for debugging
- Time-travel capabilities for analysis
- Replay for disaster recovery
- Derived view flexibility

**Example Event Log:**
```json
[
  {"event": "player_moved", "player_id": 123, "x": 100, "y": 200, "timestamp": "..."},
  {"event": "resource_gathered", "player_id": 123, "resource": "iron_ore", "amount": 5},
  {"event": "item_crafted", "player_id": 123, "item": "iron_pickaxe", "quality": 85}
]
```

**Challenges:**
- Storage growth over time
- Query complexity for current state
- Event schema evolution

**Solutions:**
- Periodic snapshots + delta events
- Materialized views for common queries
- Event versioning and migration strategies

#### 4. Read/Write Separation (CQRS)

**Pattern Overview:**

Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates read and write models:

**Write Model (Commands):**
- Optimized for transactions
- Strong consistency
- Normalized schema
- High durability guarantees

**Read Model (Queries):**
- Optimized for retrieval speed
- Eventual consistency acceptable
- Denormalized/cached data
- Multiple specialized views

**MMORPG Application:**

```
Player Action (Command) → Write DB → Event Bus → Read Model Updates
                                                 ↓
UI Query (Query) → Read Model (Redis/Materialized Views) → Fast Response
```

**Benefits:**
- Query performance independent of write complexity
- Scale read and write tiers independently
- Specialized indexes per query type
- Reduced lock contention

**Example Scenario:**

Player crafts item:
1. Write: Transaction in PostgreSQL (item created, resources consumed, skill XP gained)
2. Event: Broadcast to event bus
3. Read Model Updates:
   - Player inventory cache (Redis)
   - Skill progress view (materialized view)
   - Crafting leaderboard (separate table)
   - Analytics warehouse (async)

Query player inventory:
- Hit Redis cache (sub-millisecond)
- Fallback to materialized view if cache miss
- Never query transactional tables directly

#### 5. Time-Series Optimization

**Context:**
Geological simulation generates massive time-series data:
- Terrain deformation over time
- Weather pattern changes
- Resource regeneration cycles
- Player activity logs

**Specialized Solutions:**

**TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL Extension):**
- Automatic table partitioning by time
- Optimized compression for old data
- Continuous aggregates for downsampling
- Retention policies for data lifecycle

**Example Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE geological_events (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  location GEOGRAPHY(POINT),
  event_type TEXT,
  magnitude FLOAT,
  affected_area GEOMETRY
);

SELECT create_hypertable('geological_events', 'time');
```

**InfluxDB (Purpose-Built Time-Series):**
- Tag-based indexing
- Built-in downsampling
- Efficient compression
- Query language optimized for time ranges

**Design Decision:**
Hybrid approach - transactional PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for historical analysis

#### 6. Geospatial Extensions

**PostGIS for Geographic Data:**

Essential for planet-scale simulation:
- Native geography/geometry types
- Spatial indexing (R-Tree, GiST)
- Distance/area calculations on sphere
- Intersection queries for regions

**Example Queries:**
```sql
-- Find all ore deposits within 1km of player
SELECT * FROM ore_deposits
WHERE ST_DWithin(
  location::geography,
  ST_Point(player_lon, player_lat)::geography,
  1000  -- meters
);

-- Calculate region area in square kilometers
SELECT ST_Area(region_boundary::geography) / 1000000 as area_km2
FROM world_regions
WHERE region_id = 'europe';
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Spatial indexes critical for query speed
- Geography type (spherical) vs geometry (planar) trade-offs
- Pre-compute expensive operations
- Use appropriate spatial reference systems (SRID 4326 for WGS84)

## Implications for BlueMarble

### Architecture Recommendations

**Primary Database: PostgreSQL with Extensions**

Rationale:
- ACID guarantees for critical game state
- PostGIS for geospatial queries
- TimescaleDB for geological time-series
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Strong consistency where needed

**Cache Layer: Redis**

Rationale:
- Sub-millisecond latency for hot data
- Pub/sub for real-time events
- Geospatial commands (GEORADIUS)
- TTL for automatic cache invalidation

**Analytics: Separate Data Warehouse**

Rationale:
- Isolate complex analytical queries
- Historical data without affecting live performance
- Specialized query optimization
- Business intelligence tools integration

### Sharding Strategy

**Proposed Approach: Geographic + Feature Hybrid**

**Geographic Shards (World State):**
```
North America: Shard 1 (Players in lat/lon range)
Europe: Shard 2
Asia: Shard 3
```

**Feature Shards (Cross-Region Data):**
```
Global Player Accounts: Shard 4
Global Market/Economy: Shard 5
Global Chat/Social: Shard 6
```

**Benefits:**
- Query locality for world interactions
- Global features accessible everywhere
- Scale bottlenecks independently
- Regional latency optimization

**Challenges:**
- Cross-shard player movement
- Global query federation
- Rebalancing as player distribution changes

### Consistency Model

**Tiered Consistency Approach:**

**Tier 1 - Strong Consistency (ACID):**
- Player accounts and authentication
- Inventory and item transactions
- Economy (currency, trading)
- Critical skill/progression updates

**Tier 2 - Timeline Consistency (Event Sourcing):**
- World state changes (geological events)
- Player actions and movement
- Crafting operations
- Guild/social updates

**Tier 3 - Eventual Consistency:**
- Chat messages
- Player presence indicators
- Non-critical telemetry
- Leaderboards and rankings

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Monolithic PostgreSQL**
- Single database during alpha/early beta
- Validate schema design
- Establish performance baselines
- Defer sharding complexity

**Phase 2: Read Replicas + Redis Cache**
- Add read replicas for query scaling
- Implement Redis for hot player data
- CQRS pattern for high-traffic queries
- Monitoring and optimization

**Phase 3: Vertical Sharding**
- Split features into separate databases
- Separate world state from player accounts
- Independent scaling per feature
- Cross-database query federation

**Phase 4: Horizontal Sharding**
- Geographic sharding of world database
- Player migration between shards
- Global query routing
- Full distributed architecture

### Monitoring and Operations

**Critical Metrics:**
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Transaction throughput
- Replication lag
- Cache hit rates
- Disk I/O and space utilization
- Connection pool saturation

**Tools:**
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- Postgres pg_stat_statements for query analysis
- Redis INFO for cache monitoring
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin) for request paths
