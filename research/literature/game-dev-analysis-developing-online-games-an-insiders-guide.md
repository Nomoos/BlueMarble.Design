## Part I: Online Game Business Models

### 1. Subscription Model

**Traditional MMORPG Model:**

The subscription model charges players a recurring fee (typically monthly) for access to the game.

**Advantages for BlueMarble:**
- Predictable revenue stream for planning
- All players on equal footing (no pay-to-win concerns)
- Higher quality player base (payment barrier filters casual trolls)
- Aligns dev incentives with player experience (retain subscribers)

**Disadvantages:**
- High barrier to entry limits player acquisition
- Requires constant content updates to justify ongoing cost
- Vulnerable to competition from F2P games
- Declining market acceptance (F2P is now norm)

**Implementation Considerations:**

```
Pricing Tiers:
- Monthly: $14.99
- 3-Month: $39.99 ($13.33/month, 11% savings)
- 6-Month: $74.99 ($12.50/month, 17% savings)
- Annual: $139.99 ($11.67/month, 22% savings)

Free Trial: 14 days (limited to specific regions/levels)
Veteran Return Program: Free 7-day access for inactive accounts
Recruit-a-Friend: 1 free month for recruiter when friend subscribes
```

### 2. Free-to-Play with Microtransactions

**Modern Monetization Approach:**

F2P removes the initial cost barrier, monetizing through optional purchases.

**Revenue Categories:**
1. **Cosmetic Items**: Character skins, mounts, pets, housing decorations
2. **Convenience Items**: Inventory expansion, fast travel, auto-loot
3. **Time Savers**: Experience boosters, crafting speed-ups (controversial)
4. **Battle Passes**: Seasonal progression with rewards (hybrid approach)

**BlueMarble F2P Strategy:**

```
Core Game: Free (100% of content accessible)

Cosmetic Store:
- Character Skins: $5-$15
- Mount Skins: $10-$25
- Housing Items: $2-$50
- Emotes/Animations: $3-$8

Convenience (Non-P2W):
- Bank Slots: $5 per 10 slots
- Character Slots: $10 per slot
- Auction House Access: $5/month or free for premium
- Fast Travel Unlocks: $3 per major city

Premium Subscription ($9.99/month):
- Reduced fast travel costs
- Priority queue access
- +50% gold/XP (to level cap only)
- Monthly cosmetic allowance ($10 value)
- Access to premium support queue
```

**Critical Rule: No Pay-to-Win**
- No stat boosts purchasable with real money
- No gear/weapons in cash shop
- No resurrection items (circumvents death penalty)
- No auction house listings with real money

### 3. Hybrid Model (Recommended for BlueMarble)

**Best of Both Worlds:**

Offer both free access and optional subscription with benefits.

**BlueMarble Hybrid Model:**

```
Free Players:
- Full game access
- Standard queue priority
- Standard XP/gold rates
- Can purchase cosmetics

Premium Subscribers ($9.99/month):
- Priority login queue (important for launch/expansions)
- +50% XP until level cap (new player friendly)
- +25% gold from all sources
- Monthly cosmetic token ($10 store credit)
- Access to premium player housing
- Free auction house listing fees
- Priority customer support

One-Time Purchases:
- Expansions: $39.99 (required for all players)

        self.session_id = generate_session_id()
        self.player_id = None
        
    def track_login(self, player_id, login_method):
        """Track player login"""
        event = {
            'event_type': 'login',
            'player_id': player_id,
            'session_id': self.session_id,
            'login_method': login_method,
            'timestamp': utc_now(),
            'client_version': get_client_version(),
            'platform': get_platform()
        }
        send_to_analytics(event)
    
    def track_quest_complete(self, player_id, quest_id, time_taken):
        """Track quest completion"""
        event = {
            'event_type': 'quest_complete',
            'player_id': player_id,
            'quest_id': quest_id,
            'time_taken_seconds': time_taken,
            'player_level': get_player_level(player_id),
            'timestamp': utc_now()
        }
        send_to_analytics(event)
    
    def track_purchase(self, player_id, item_id, price, currency):
        """Track in-game or real money purchase"""
        event = {
            'event_type': 'purchase',
            'player_id': player_id,
            'item_id': item_id,
            'price': price,
            'currency': currency,  # 'gold', 'usd', 'premium_currency'
            'timestamp': utc_now()
        }
        send_to_analytics(event)
        
    def track_death(self, player_id, killer_id, location, player_level):
        """Track player death for balance analysis"""
        event = {
            'event_type': 'death',
            'player_id': player_id,
            'killer_id': killer_id,
            'killer_type': get_entity_type(killer_id),  # 'player', 'npc', 'environment'
            'location': location,
            'player_level': player_level,
            'timestamp': utc_now()
        }
        send_to_analytics(event)
```

### 3. A/B Testing for Game Design

**Experimental Framework:**

```
A/B Test Example: Quest Reward Optimization

Hypothesis: Increasing gold rewards by 20% will improve 
           quest completion rate without harming economy

Test Groups:
- Control (50%): Standard 100 gold reward
- Variant A (25%): 120 gold reward (+20%)
- Variant B (25%): 80 gold reward (-20%)

Metrics to Track:
- Quest completion rate
- Time to complete quest
- Quest abandonment rate
- Player progression speed
- Gold per hour (economy impact)
- Player satisfaction (survey)

Duration: 2 weeks
Sample Size: Minimum 10,000 players per group

Analysis:
if variant_a.completion_rate > control.completion_rate * 1.05:
    if economy_impact < threshold:
        implement_variant_a()
    else:
        run_followup_test_with_adjustment()
```
