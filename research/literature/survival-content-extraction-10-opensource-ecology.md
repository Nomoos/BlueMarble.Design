    # ... all 50 machines
]

for machine_name, tier in machines:

6. Add machine dependencies (prerequisites)
7. Include maintenance requirements

**Material Mapping:**
```python
# Map OSE materials to BlueMarble items
material_mapping = {
    'steel plate': 'steel_plate',
    '1" x 1" steel tubing': 'steel_tubing_1inch',
    'hydraulic cylinder': 'hydraulic_cylinder',
    'diesel engine': 'diesel_engine_27hp',
    'ball bearings': 'bearing_ball',
    # ... complete mapping
}
```

### Step 4: Dependency Tree Creation (Week 3-4)

**Machine Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "machine_dependencies": {
    "power_cube": {
      "required_for": [
        "tractor",
        "cement_mixer",
        "well_driller",
        "trencher"
      ],
      "prerequisites": [
        "welder",
        "drill_press"
      ]
    },
    "tractor": {
      "required_for": [
        "backhoe",
        "bulldozer",
        "universal_rotor"
