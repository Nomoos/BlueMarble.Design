## Overview

This document analyzes competitive tournament and progression systems from popular anime series, specifically **Hunter x Hunter's Heavens Arena** and **Tower of God's Tower climbing system**, to explore their application as player tournament mechanics in BlueMarble MMORPG.

**Research Question:**
Can anime-inspired tournament/progression systems like those in Hunter x Hunter and Tower of God be adapted into engaging player tournament content for BlueMarble?

**Key Concepts Analyzed:**
- Tiered competitive progression systems
- Risk/reward tournament mechanics
- Ranking and matchmaking systems
- Spectator-friendly competitive content
- Long-term progression hooks

## Source Material Overview

### Hunter x Hunter - Heavens Arena

**Series Context:**
Hunter x Hunter (1999, 2011) features the Heavens Arena arc, a 251-floor combat tower where fighters compete for money, fame, and glory.

**Key Mechanics:**
- **Tiered Floor System:** Fighters progress through 251 floors, with major milestones at floors 50, 100, 150, 200
- **Win/Loss Stakes:** Victories advance you; losses can drop you down floors
- **Currency Rewards:** Prize money increases exponentially with floor height
- **Floor Masters:** Elite fighters who own floors 230-250
- **Public Spectacle:** High-floor matches are televised and watched by thousands
- **Nen Introduction:** Floor 200+ introduces supernatural abilities (analogous to advanced skills)

**Progression Structure:**
```
Floors 1-100:   Anyone can enter, basic combat
Floors 101-150: Intermediate fighters, significant rewards
Floors 151-199: Advanced fighters, celebrity status
Floor 200+:     Nen users only (advanced mechanics), high stakes
Floors 230-250: Floor Masters (champions), invite-only matches
```

### Tower of God - Tower Climbing System

**Series Context:**
Tower of God (Webtoon 2010, Anime 2020) features a mysterious tower where climbers must pass tests on each floor to ascend and gain power, wealth, and fulfill wishes.

**Key Mechanics:**
- **Floor-by-Floor Progression:** Each floor has unique tests/challenges
- **Team-Based Challenges:** Many tests require cooperation and strategy
- **Rankers System:** Those who reach the top become "Rankers" with special status
- **Diverse Test Types:** Combat, puzzles, team coordination, survival
- **Administrator Approval:** Each floor has an administrator who controls entry
- **Position System:** Players specialize in roles (Fisherman/DPS, Light Bearer/Support, etc.)
- **Irregular Status:** Special players who bypass normal rules (analogous to special events)

**Progression Structure:**
```
Floor 1-20:     Tutorial tests, basic ability discovery
Floor 21-50:    Intermediate challenges, team formation critical
Floor 51-100:   Advanced tests, reputation building
Floor 101-134:  High-level challenges, rare rewards
Floor 135:      "TOP" - Reaching here grants Ranker status
```

## Tournament System Design Analysis

### 1. Tiered Progression Model

**Concept:**
Both systems use vertical progression with clear tier boundaries and increasingly difficult challenges.

**Design Principles:**
- **Clear Milestones:** Players understand what they're working toward
- **Skill Gating:** Higher tiers require genuine skill/knowledge improvement
- **Psychological Investment:** Climbing creates sense of achievement
- **Natural Matchmaking:** Tier placement ensures fair competition
- **Aspirational Content:** Top tiers visible but exclusive

**BlueMarble Application:**

```csharp
public class TournamentTierSystem
{
    public enum TournamentTier
    {
        Bronze,      // Entry level, all players
        Silver,      // Competent fighters
        Gold,        // Skilled players
        Platinum,    // Expert level
        Diamond,     // Elite players
        Champion     // Tournament champions
    }
    
    public class TierRequirements
    {
        public int MinimumWins { get; set; }
        public float WinRateThreshold { get; set; }
        public int MinimumMatches { get; set; }
        public bool RequireSkillCheck { get; set; }
        public List<string> RequiredAchievements { get; set; }
    }
    
    public Dictionary<TournamentTier, TierRequirements> TierGates = new()
    {
        { TournamentTier.Bronze, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 0,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.0f,
            MinimumMatches = 0,
            RequireSkillCheck = false
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Silver, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 10,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.40f,
            MinimumMatches = 20,
            RequireSkillCheck = false
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Gold, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 30,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.50f,
            MinimumMatches = 50,
            RequireSkillCheck = true
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Platinum, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 100,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.55f,
            MinimumMatches = 150,
            RequireSkillCheck = true,
            RequiredAchievements = new List<string> { "Geological_Mastery", "Advanced_Combat" }
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Diamond, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 250,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.60f,
            MinimumMatches = 350,
            RequireSkillCheck = true,
            RequiredAchievements = new List<string> { 
                "Geological_Mastery", 
                "Advanced_Combat", 
                "Tournament_Veteran" 
            }
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Champion, new TierRequirements {
            MinimumWins = 500,
            WinRateThreshold = 0.65f,
            MinimumMatches = 700,
            RequireSkillCheck = true,
            RequiredAchievements = new List<string> { 
                "Geological_Mastery", 
                "Advanced_Combat", 
                "Tournament_Veteran",
                "Top_10_Finisher" 
            }
        }}
    };
}
```

### 2. Risk/Reward Mechanics

**Hunter x Hunter Model:**

Heavens Arena uses escalating stakes:
- **Low Floors:** Small entry fee, small rewards, minimal risk
- **Mid Floors:** Higher stakes, significant rewards, reputation gain
- **High Floors:** No entry fee, massive rewards, reputation risk
- **Floor 200+:** Can't drop below 200, but losses hurt ranking

**Tower of God Model:**

Tower uses pass/fail with permanent consequences:
- **Success:** Advance to next floor, gain abilities/items
- **Failure:** Can mean death (in lore), but typically retry or elimination
- **Team Risk:** Failure can affect entire team
- **High Stakes Tests:** Some tests are life-or-death (analogous to elimination tournaments)

**BlueMarble Tournament Risk/Reward System:**

```csharp
public class TournamentRiskRewardSystem
{
    public class TournamentMatch
    {
        public TournamentTier Tier { get; set; }
        public int EntryFee { get; set; }
        public RewardPool Rewards { get; set; }
        public RankingImpact RankingChange { get; set; }
    }
    
    public class RewardPool
    {
        public int GoldReward { get; set; }
        public int HonorPoints { get; set; }
        public List<Item> PotentialItems { get; set; }
        public int RankingPoints { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public int SpectatorPayouts { get; set; }  // Winner gets % of spectator fees
    }
    
    public TournamentMatch GetMatchParameters(TournamentTier tier)
    {
        return tier switch
        {
            TournamentTier.Bronze => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 100,
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 500,
                    HonorPoints = 10,
                    RankingPoints = 5
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 5, LossPenalty = -2 }
            },
            TournamentTier.Silver => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 500,
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 3000,
                    HonorPoints = 50,
                    RankingPoints = 15,
                    PotentialItems = GetTierLoot(tier)
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 15, LossPenalty = -7 }
            },
            TournamentTier.Gold => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 2000,
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 15000,
                    HonorPoints = 200,
                    RankingPoints = 40,
                    PotentialItems = GetTierLoot(tier)
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 40, LossPenalty = -15 }
            },
            TournamentTier.Platinum => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 10000,
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 75000,
                    HonorPoints = 750,
                    RankingPoints = 100,
                    PotentialItems = GetTierLoot(tier),
                    SpectatorPayouts = 0  // Spectators pay to watch
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 100, LossPenalty = -35 }
            },
            TournamentTier.Diamond => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 0,  // Invitation only, no fee
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 250000,
                    HonorPoints = 2500,
                    RankingPoints = 300,
                    PotentialItems = GetTierLoot(tier),
                    Title = "Diamond Fighter",
                    SpectatorPayouts = 5000  // Base + % of ticket sales
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 300, LossPenalty = -75 }
            },
            TournamentTier.Champion => new TournamentMatch
            {
                Tier = tier,
                EntryFee = 0,  // Top 8 players only
                Rewards = new RewardPool
                {
                    GoldReward = 1000000,
                    HonorPoints = 10000,
                    RankingPoints = 1000,
                    PotentialItems = GetTierLoot(tier),
                    Title = "Arena Champion",
                    SpectatorPayouts = 50000  // Massive spectator revenue
                },
                RankingChange = new RankingImpact { WinGain = 1000, LossPenalty = -150 }
            },
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid tier")
        };
    }
}
```

### 3. Spectator and Community Engagement

**Key Insight from Both Series:**

High-level matches are public spectacles that engage the entire community, not just participants.

**Design Elements:**
- **Viewable Matches:** Players can watch matches in progress
- **Betting Systems:** Spectators can wager on outcomes
- **Leaderboards:** Public rankings create drama and rivalry
- **Commentary/Replay:** Recorded matches can be analyzed
- **Celebrity Status:** Top fighters become server celebrities

**BlueMarble Implementation:**

```csharp
public class TournamentSpectatorSystem
{
    public class SpectatorFeatures
    {
        // Live viewing arena
        public bool EnableLiveViewing { get; set; } = true;
        public int MaxSpectators { get; set; }
        public int TicketPrice { get; set; }
        
        // Betting system
        public bool EnableBetting { get; set; }
        public int MinBet { get; set; }
        public int MaxBet { get; set; }
        public float HouseEdge { get; set; } = 0.05f;  // 5% house cut
        
        // Replay system
        public bool EnableReplays { get; set; }
        public int ReplayStorageDays { get; set; } = 30;
        public bool AllowCommentary { get; set; }
        
        // Social features
        public bool EnableChat { get; set; }
        public bool ShowPlayerStats { get; set; }
        public bool EnableCheering { get; set; }  // Emotes, buffs
    }
    
    public Dictionary<TournamentTier, SpectatorFeatures> SpectatorSettings = new()
    {
        { TournamentTier.Bronze, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = 10,
            TicketPrice = 0,
            EnableBetting = false
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Silver, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = 25,
            TicketPrice = 10,
            EnableBetting = true,
            MinBet = 10,
            MaxBet = 100
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Gold, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = 50,
            TicketPrice = 50,
            EnableBetting = true,
            MinBet = 50,
            MaxBet = 500,
            EnableReplays = true
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Platinum, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = 100,
            TicketPrice = 200,
            EnableBetting = true,
            MinBet = 100,
            MaxBet = 2000,
            EnableReplays = true,
            AllowCommentary = true
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Diamond, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = 500,
            TicketPrice = 500,
            EnableBetting = true,
            MinBet = 500,
            MaxBet = 10000,
            EnableReplays = true,
            AllowCommentary = true,
            ShowPlayerStats = true,
            EnableCheering = true
        }},
        { TournamentTier.Champion, new SpectatorFeatures {
            MaxSpectators = int.MaxValue,  // Unlimited via instancing
            TicketPrice = 1000,
            EnableBetting = true,
            MinBet = 1000,
            MaxBet = 50000,
            EnableReplays = true,
            AllowCommentary = true,
            ShowPlayerStats = true,
            EnableCheering = true
        }}
    };
    
    public void BroadcastMatchNotification(TournamentMatch match)
    {
        // Server-wide announcements for high-tier matches
        if (match.Tier >= TournamentTier.Platinum)
        {
            SendServerMessage($"TOURNAMENT: {match.Tier} tier match starting!");
            SendServerMessage($"Fighters: {match.Player1.Name} vs {match.Player2.Name}");
            SendServerMessage($"Spectate at Arena for {match.TicketPrice} gold");
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Team-Based Tournament Variants

**Tower of God Inspiration:**

Many tests in Tower of God require team coordination, creating opportunities for guild/party tournament content.

**BlueMarble Team Tournament Types:**

```csharp
public class TeamTournamentSystem
{
    public enum TeamTournamentType
    {
        Duo,            // 2v2 combat
        Squad,          // 5v5 tactical combat
        Raid,           // 10v10 large-scale battles
        GuildWar,       // Guild vs Guild with objectives
        CooperativeTest // PvE challenge (Tower of God style)
    }
    
    public class TeamTournamentConfig
    {
        public TeamTournamentType Type { get; set; }
        public int TeamSize { get; set; }
        public int Duration { get; set; }  // Minutes
        public List<Objective> Objectives { get; set; }
        public VictoryCondition WinCondition { get; set; }
    }
    
    public class CooperativeTestConfig
    {
        // Tower of God style: Team must complete challenge together
        public string TestName { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public int RequiredPlayers { get; set; }
        public int TimeLimit { get; set; }
        public List<TestObjective> Objectives { get; set; }
        public RewardPool TeamRewards { get; set; }
        public RewardPool IndividualRewards { get; set; }
        
        // Example: "Geological Disaster Response"
        // Team must work together to stabilize collapsing mine
        // Roles: Tank blocks debris, Healer treats injured NPCs, 
        //        DPS clears monsters, Support repairs structures
    }
    
    public List<CooperativeTestConfig> TowerStyleTests = new()
    {
        new CooperativeTestConfig
        {
            TestName = "Floor 1: Resource Extraction Race",
            Description = "Team must collect 1000 minerals within 15 minutes while defending against waves of enemies",
            RequiredPlayers = 4,
            TimeLimit = 900,  // 15 minutes
            Objectives = new List<TestObjective>
            {
                new TestObjective { Type = "Gather", Target = "Minerals", Quantity = 1000 },
                new TestObjective { Type = "Survive", Target = "All Players", Quantity = 4 },
                new TestObjective { Type = "Defend", Target = "Extraction Point", Health = 100 }
            }
        },
        new CooperativeTestConfig
        {
            TestName = "Floor 10: The Geological Puzzle",
            Description = "Team must identify and collect specific mineral samples while navigating dangerous terrain",
            RequiredPlayers = 5,
            TimeLimit = 1200,  // 20 minutes
            Objectives = new List<TestObjective>
            {
                new TestObjective { Type = "Identify", Target = "Rare Minerals", Quantity = 10 },
                new TestObjective { Type = "Navigate", Target = "Unstable Terrain", Distance = 5000 },
                new TestObjective { Type = "Cooperate", Target = "Puzzle Mechanisms", Quantity = 5 }
            }
        }
        // ... more floors with increasing difficulty
    };
}
```

### 5. Ranking and Matchmaking Systems

**Design Principles from Both Series:**

- **Skill-Based Matching:** Players face opponents of similar skill
- **Ranking Persistence:** Rankings carry prestige and unlock content
- **Seasonal Resets:** Periodic resets keep competition fresh
- **Transparent Criteria:** Players understand how ranking works

**BlueMarble Ranking System:**

```csharp
public class TournamentRankingSystem
{
    public class PlayerRanking
    {
        public string PlayerId { get; set; }
        public int RankingPoints { get; set; }
        public int GlobalRank { get; set; }
        public TournamentTier CurrentTier { get; set; }
        public int ConsecutiveWins { get; set; }
        public int TotalMatches { get; set; }
        public int TotalWins { get; set; }
        public float WinRate => (float)TotalWins / TotalMatches;
        public int SeasonNumber { get; set; }
        public List<Achievement> TournamentAchievements { get; set; }
        public Dictionary<string, int> OpponentVictories { get; set; }  // Head-to-head records
    }
    
    public class MatchmakingAlgorithm
    {
        public PlayerRanking FindOpponent(PlayerRanking player)

                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
