## Work Guidelines

### Research Process

1. **Source Review** (30% of time)
   - Read/review source material thoroughly
   - Take structured notes
   - Identify key concepts relevant to BlueMarble

2. **Analysis** (40% of time)
   - Compare with existing BlueMarble systems
   - Identify integration opportunities
   - Evaluate technical feasibility
   - Consider scalability implications

3. **Documentation** (30% of time)
   - Write comprehensive analysis document
   - Include code examples where appropriate
   - Add cross-references to related research
   - Provide clear recommendations

### Document Structure

Each analysis document should include:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and recommendations
2. **Source Overview** - What was analyzed
3. **Core Concepts** - Main ideas and patterns
4. **BlueMarble Application** - How to apply to project
5. **Implementation Recommendations** - Specific action items
6. **References** - Citations and further reading

### Quality Standards

- **Minimum Length:** As specified per topic (varies by priority)
- **Code Examples:** Include where relevant
- **Citations:** Proper attribution of sources
- **Cross-References:** Link to related research documents
- **Front Matter:** Include YAML front matter with metadata

### Discovery Template

For each newly discovered source, add an entry:

```markdown
**Source Name:** [Title of discovered source]
**Discovered From:** [Which topic led to this discovery]
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low - your assessment]
**Category:** [GameDev-Tech/GameDev-Design/GameDev-Content/Survival/etc.]
**Rationale:** [Why this source is relevant to BlueMarble]
**Estimated Effort:** [Hours needed for analysis]
```

### Discovered Sources Log

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create documents in `research/literature/` directory
2. Use kebab-case naming: `game-dev-analysis-[topic].md` or `survival-content-extraction-[topic].md`
3. Include proper YAML front matter
4. Update master research queue upon completion
5. Cross-link with related documents
6. Log any newly discovered sources in section above

---

## Support and Questions

- Review existing completed documents for format examples
