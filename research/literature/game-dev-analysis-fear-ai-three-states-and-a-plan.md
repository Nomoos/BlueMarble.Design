## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the landmark GDC 2006 presentation by Jeff Orkin on F.E.A.R.'s AI system, which revolutionized game AI through its implementation of Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP). The presentation reveals how a relatively simple planning system with only three state variables created emergent, believable combat behaviors that made F.E.A.R.'s AI legendary in the gaming industry.

**Key Takeaways for BlueMarble:**
- **Simplicity over complexity:** F.E.A.R. used only 3 world state variables but created highly believable AI
- **Action planning at runtime:** NPCs dynamically chain actions to achieve goals, creating emergent behavior
- **Sensory system integration:** Realistic perception and memory systems made AI feel intelligent
- **Animation-driven design:** Tight integration between planning and animation prevented unrealistic behaviors
- **Squad coordination:** Emergent squad tactics from individual agent planning without centralized squad AI

**Implementation Priority for BlueMarble:**
1. Core GOAP planner (Critical - enables all NPC planning)
2. Sensory and memory systems (High - makes NPCs feel aware)
3. Animation integration (High - prevents immersion-breaking behaviors)
4. Squad communication (Medium - enables faction coordination)

## Core Concept: Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)

### What Made F.E.A.R.'s AI Special

F.E.A.R.'s AI became famous not for complex algorithms, but for creating the *illusion* of intelligence through:

1. **Dynamic Planning:** NPCs chose actions at runtime based on current situation
2. **Emergent Behavior:** Complex squad tactics emerged from simple individual behaviors
3. **Natural Failures:** When plans failed, NPCs adapted realistically
4. **Believable Reactions:** NPCs responded to player actions in contextually appropriate ways

### The Three States

F.E.A.R.'s world state used only **three boolean variables:**

```cpp
struct WorldState {
    bool atTarget;        // Is NPC at the target location?
    bool targetDead;      // Is the target (enemy) dead?
    bool weaponLoaded;    // Does NPC have ammo in weapon?
};
```

This minimalist approach proved that **emergent complexity doesn't require complex state.**

---

## Part I: GOAP Architecture in F.E.A.R.

### 1. Goals and Actions

**Goals Define Desires:**
```cpp
enum class Goal {
    KillEnemy,          // Primary combat goal
    InvestigateSound,   // Investigate disturbance
    Patrol,             // Default behavior when idle
    TakeCover,          // Respond to being under fire
    Flee                // Retreat when overwhelmed
};

// Goal conditions (desired world state)
WorldState GetGoalState(Goal goal) {
    switch (goal) {
        case Goal::KillEnemy:
            return WorldState{
                .atTarget = true,      // Be at enemy
                .targetDead = true,    // Enemy is dead
                .weaponLoaded = true   // Have ammo
            };
        case Goal::TakeCover:
            return WorldState{
                .atTarget = true,      // At cover position
                .targetDead = false,   // Don't care about enemy
                .weaponLoaded = true   // Be ready
            };
        // ... other goals
    }
}
```

**Actions Have Preconditions and Effects:**
```cpp
struct Action {
    std::string name;
    float cost;
    WorldState preconditions;   // What must be true to execute
    WorldState effects;         // What becomes true after execution
    
    bool (*CanExecute)(NPC& npc);
    void (*Execute)(NPC& npc);
};

// Example: Move to target action
Action moveToTarget = {
    .name = "MoveToTarget",
    .cost = 1.0f,
    .preconditions = {
        .atTarget = false,     // Not already at target
        .targetDead = false,   // Target still alive
        .weaponLoaded = true   // Have ammo (don't move unarmed)
    },
    .effects = {
        .atTarget = true,      // Will be at target after moving
        .targetDead = false,   // Movement doesn't kill target
        .weaponLoaded = true   // Still have ammo
    },
    .CanExecute = [](NPC& npc) {
        return npc.HasPathToTarget();
    },
    .Execute = [](NPC& npc) {
        npc.StartMovingToTarget();
    }
};

// Example: Shoot target action
Action shootTarget = {
    .name = "ShootTarget",
    .cost = 1.0f,
    .preconditions = {
        .atTarget = true,      // Must be at target (in range)
        .targetDead = false,   // Target still alive
        .weaponLoaded = true   // Have ammo
    },
    .effects = {
        .atTarget = true,      // Still at target
        .targetDead = true,    // Target will be dead
        .weaponLoaded = true   // Still have ammo (simplified)
    },
    .CanExecute = [](NPC& npc) {
        return npc.CanSeeTarget() && npc.InWeaponRange();
    },
    .Execute = [](NPC& npc) {
        npc.AimAndShoot();
    }
};

// Example: Reload weapon action
Action reloadWeapon = {
    .name = "ReloadWeapon",
    .cost = 2.0f,  // Higher cost - avoid reloading in combat
    .preconditions = {
        .atTarget = false,     // Don't reload when exposed
        .targetDead = false,   // Target still alive
        .weaponLoaded = false  // Need to reload
    },
    .effects = {
        .atTarget = false,     // Still not at target
        .targetDead = false,   // Reloading doesn't kill
        .weaponLoaded = true   // Weapon now loaded
    },
    .CanExecute = [](NPC& npc) {
        return npc.HasAmmo() && npc.IsInCover();
    },
    .Execute = [](NPC& npc) {
        npc.PlayReloadAnimation();
    }
};
```

### 2. The Planning Algorithm

F.E.A.R. used **backward planning** from goal to current state:

```cpp
class GOAPPlanner {
public:
    std::vector<Action*> CreatePlan(
        const WorldState& currentState,
        const WorldState& goalState,
        const std::vector<Action>& availableActions
    ) {
        // A* search through action space
        struct PlanNode {
            WorldState state;
            std::vector<Action*> plan;
            float costSoFar;
            
            bool operator>(const PlanNode& other) const {
                return costSoFar > other.costSoFar;
            }
        };
        
        std::priority_queue<PlanNode, std::vector<PlanNode>, 
                          std::greater<PlanNode>> openSet;
        std::unordered_set<WorldState> closedSet;
        
        // Start from goal and work backward
        openSet.push(PlanNode{goalState, {}, 0.0f});
        
        while (!openSet.empty()) {
            PlanNode current = openSet.top();
            openSet.pop();
            
            // Found plan if we reached current state
            if (current.state == currentState) {
                std::reverse(current.plan.begin(), current.plan.end());
                return current.plan;
            }
            
            if (closedSet.count(current.state)) continue;
            closedSet.insert(current.state);
            
            // Try all actions that could lead to current node state
            for (const Action& action : availableActions) {
                // Can this action produce the current state?
                if (!StateMatchesEffects(current.state, action.effects)) {
                    continue;
                }
                
                // Create predecessor state (undo action effects)
                WorldState predecessorState = 
                    CreatePredecessorState(current.state, action);
                
                PlanNode newNode{
                    predecessorState,
                    current.plan,
                    current.costSoFar + action.cost
                };
                newNode.plan.push_back(&action);
                
                openSet.push(newNode);
            }
        }
        
        return {};  // No plan found
    }
    
private:
    bool StateMatchesEffects(const WorldState& state, 
                            const WorldState& effects) {
        // Check if action effects satisfy state requirements
        if (state.atTarget && !effects.atTarget) return false;
        if (state.targetDead && !effects.targetDead) return false;
        if (state.weaponLoaded && !effects.weaponLoaded) return false;
        return true;
    }
    
    WorldState CreatePredecessorState(const WorldState& state,
                                     const Action& action) {
        // Combine current state with action preconditions
        WorldState predecessor = action.preconditions;
        
        // Inherit state properties not affected by action
        if (!action.effects.atTarget) 
            predecessor.atTarget = state.atTarget;
        if (!action.effects.targetDead) 
            predecessor.targetDead = state.targetDead;
        if (!action.effects.weaponLoaded) 
            predecessor.weaponLoaded = state.weaponLoaded;
            
        return predecessor;
    }
};
```

**Example Plan Generation:**

Current State: `{atTarget=false, targetDead=false, weaponLoaded=true}`  
Goal State: `{atTarget=true, targetDead=true, weaponLoaded=true}`

Plan found:
1. `MoveToTarget` - Gets to shooting position
2. `ShootTarget` - Eliminates enemy

## Part II: Sensory and Memory Systems

### 1. Realistic Perception

F.E.A.R.'s NPCs didn't have "ESP" - they used realistic sensory systems:

```cpp
class SensorySystem {
public:
    struct Stimulus {
        enum class Type { Visual, Sound, Touch, Smell };
        Type type;
        Vector3 position;
        Entity* source;
        float intensity;
        float timestamp;
    };
    
    // Vision cone with distance falloff
    bool CanSee(NPC& npc, Entity* target) {
        Vector3 toTarget = target->position - npc.position;
        float distance = toTarget.Length();
        
        // Distance check
        if (distance > npc.visionRange) return false;
        
        // Field of view check (cone)
        Vector3 forward = npc.GetForwardVector();
        float angle = acos(Dot(forward, toTarget.Normalized()));
        if (angle > npc.visionConeAngle / 2) return false;
        
        // Line of sight check (raycasting)
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (Physics::Raycast(npc.position, toTarget.Normalized(), 
                            distance, hit)) {
            if (hit.entity != target) return false;  // Blocked
        }
        
        // Lighting and contrast (advanced)
        float visibility = CalculateVisibility(target, npc);
        if (visibility < 0.3f) return false;  // Too dark/hidden
        
        return true;
    }
    
    // Sound propagation
    void PropagateSound(Vector3 position, float loudness, 
                       Entity* source) {
        for (NPC* npc : GetNearbyNPCs(position, loudness * 50.0f)) {
            float distance = Distance(npc->position, position);
            float attenuatedLoudness = loudness / (1 + distance * 0.1f);
            
            if (attenuatedLoudness > npc->hearingThreshold) {
                npc->memory.RecordStimulus(Stimulus{
                    .type = Stimulus::Type::Sound,
                    .position = position,
                    .source = source,
                    .intensity = attenuatedLoudness,
                    .timestamp = GetTime()
                });
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### 2. Memory and Knowledge

NPCs remembered what they sensed, with decay over time:

```cpp
class NPCMemory {
public:
    struct MemoryRecord {
        Entity* entity;
        Vector3 lastKnownPosition;
        float lastSeenTime;
        float certainty;  // 0.0 - 1.0, decays over time
        bool isThreat;
    };
    
    void UpdateMemory(float deltaTime) {
        for (auto& [entity, record] : memories) {
            float timeSinceLastSeen = GetTime() - record.lastSeenTime;
            
            // Decay certainty over time
            record.certainty *= exp(-timeSinceLastSeen * decayRate);
            
            // Forget if certainty too low
            if (record.certainty < 0.1f) {
                memories.erase(entity);
            }
        }
    }
    
    Vector3 GetLastKnownPosition(Entity* entity) {
        auto it = memories.find(entity);
        if (it != memories.end()) {
            return it->second.lastKnownPosition;
        }
        return Vector3::Zero;  // Don't know
    }
    
    // NPC acts on memory, not reality
    Entity* GetMostThreateningEnemy() {
        Entity* mostThreatening = nullptr;
        float highestThreat = 0.0f;
        
        for (auto& [entity, record] : memories) {
            if (!record.isThreat) continue;
            
            float threat = record.certainty * 
                          (1.0f / (1.0f + TimeSince(record.lastSeenTime)));
            
            if (threat > highestThreat) {
                highestThreat = threat;
                mostThreatening = entity;
            }
        }
        
        return mostThreatening;
    }
    
private:
    std::unordered_map<Entity*, MemoryRecord> memories;
    float decayRate = 0.1f;  // Certainty half-life
};
```

**Key Insight:** NPCs acted on *beliefs* (memory) not *truth* (reality). This created:
- Searching behavior when losing sight of player
- Investigating last known positions
- False alarms and mistakes (making AI feel human)

---

## Part III: Animation Integration

### The Animation Problem

Traditional approach: Play animation â†’ Wait for completion â†’ Execute next action

F.E.A.R.'s solution: **Actions are animations**

```cpp
class AnimationDrivenAction {
public:
    enum class State { NotStarted, Running, Complete, Failed };
    
    struct ActionExecution {
        Action* action;
        AnimationClip* animation;
        State state;
        float startTime;
        
        // Animation callbacks
        std::function<void()> onAnimationMidpoint;
        std::function<void()> onAnimationComplete;
    };
    
    void ExecuteAction(NPC& npc, Action* action) {
        // Each action has associated animation
        AnimationClip* anim = GetAnimationForAction(action);
        
        ActionExecution execution{
            .action = action,
            .animation = anim,
            .state = State::Running,
            .startTime = GetTime()
        };
        
        // Set animation callbacks for game logic
        execution.onAnimationMidpoint = [&npc, action]() {
            // Actual game effect happens mid-animation
            if (action->name == "ShootTarget") {
                npc.FireWeapon();  // Bullet spawns here
            } else if (action->name == "ThrowGrenade") {
                npc.ReleaseGrenade();
            }
        };
        
        execution.onAnimationComplete = [&npc, action]() {
            // Mark action as complete, plan next action
            npc.OnActionComplete(action);
        };
        
        npc.animator.PlayAnimation(anim, execution.onAnimationMidpoint,
                                  execution.onAnimationComplete);
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Actions can't happen faster than animations allow (prevents superhuman speed)
- Smooth, natural transitions between behaviors
- Actions automatically synchronized with visual feedback
- No "teleporting" or instant state changes

**Example: Taking Cover**

```cpp
Action takeCover = {
    .name = "TakeCover",
    .cost = 3.0f,
    .preconditions = {.atTarget = false, .targetDead = false},
    .effects = {.atTarget = true},  // At cover position
    
    .Execute = [](NPC& npc) {
        // Find nearest cover point
        CoverPoint* cover = FindNearestCover(npc);
        
        // Animation takes 1-2 seconds to complete
        AnimationClip* anim = GetCoverAnimation(npc, cover);
        
        npc.PlayAnimation(anim, 
            /* midpoint */ [&npc, cover]() {
                // Halfway through animation, npc is protected
                npc.currentCover = cover;
                npc.isInCover = true;
            },
            /* complete */ [&npc]() {
                npc.isInCover = true;
                npc.state = NPCState::InCover;
            }
        );
    }
};
```

## Part IV: Squad Coordination Without Squad AI

### Emergent Squad Tactics

F.E.A.R.'s most impressive feature: **Squad tactics emerged without centralized squad AI.**

Each NPC was an independent agent, but they communicated:

```cpp
class CombatCommunication {
public:
    enum class MessageType {
        EnemySpotted,
        TakingFire,
        Flanking,
        SuppressingFire,
        ReloadingCover,
        ThrowingGrenade,
        Retreating
    };
    
    struct Message {
        MessageType type;
        NPC* sender;
        Vector3 location;
        Entity* target;
        float timestamp;
    };
    
    // Broadcast to nearby squad members
    void BroadcastMessage(NPC& sender, MessageType type, 
                         Vector3 location = Vector3::Zero,
                         Entity* target = nullptr) {
        Message msg{type, &sender, location, target, GetTime()};
        
        for (NPC* squadMember : GetSquadMembers(sender)) {
            if (Distance(sender.position, squadMember->position) < 
                communicationRange) {
                squadMember->ReceiveMessage(msg);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // NPCs adjust actions based on messages
    void OnMessageReceived(NPC& npc, const Message& msg) {
        switch (msg.type) {
            case MessageType::EnemySpotted:
                // Add to memory even if not seeing directly
                npc.memory.RecordEnemyLocation(msg.target, msg.location);
                break;
                
            case MessageType::Flanking:
                // Adjust own action to complement flanking
                if (CanSeeSameTarget(npc, msg.sender)) {
                    npc.SetAction(Action::SuppressFire);  // Cover flanker
                }
                break;
                
            case MessageType::ReloadingCover:
                // Someone reloading, maintain pressure
                if (npc.currentAction == Action::Reload) {
                    npc.PostponeReload();  // Delay own reload
                }
                break;
                
            case MessageType::ThrowingGrenade:
                // Take cover when grenade announced
                if (Distance(npc.position, msg.location) < 20.0f) {
                    npc.SetGoal(Goal::TakeCover);
                }
                break;
                
            // ... other message handlers
        }
    }
};
```

**Emergent Behaviors:**

1. **Suppressive Fire:** NPC keeps player pinned while others flank
   - NPC A sees player, broadcasts "EnemySpotted"
   - NPC B receives, starts flanking maneuver
   - NPC B broadcasts "Flanking"
   - NPC A adjusts to provide covering fire

2. **Coordinated Reloading:** Squad never all reloads at once
   - NPC A needs reload, broadcasts "ReloadingCover"
   - NPC B/C postpone own reloads
   - NPC A finishes, broadcasts "ReloadComplete"
   - NPC B can now reload safely

3. **Advancing Under Cover:** Squad moves forward in leapfrog pattern
   - NPC A in cover, firing
   - NPC B advances to next cover
   - NPC B broadcasts "InPosition"
   - NPC A now advances past B
   - Repeat

**No central coordinator needed** - tactical patterns emerged from individual agents following simple rules.

## Part V: Key Design Decisions

### 1. Keep World State Minimal

**Lesson:** More state variables â‰  smarter AI

F.E.A.R. used only 3 state variables, yet created complex behaviors. Why?

- **Easier to reason about:** Developers could mentally simulate AI behavior
- **Faster planning:** Fewer variables = smaller search space
- **Fewer bugs:** Less state = fewer edge cases
- **More maintainable:** Easy to add new actions without breaking existing ones

### 2. Cost-Based Action Selection

Actions had different costs based on situation:

```cpp
float GetActionCost(const Action& action, const NPC& npc) {
    float baseCost = action.cost;
    
    // Adjust cost based on context
    if (action.name == "Reload" && npc.IsUnderFire()) {
        baseCost *= 5.0f;  // Expensive to reload in combat
    }
    
    if (action.name == "FlankTarget" && npc.health < 0.3f) {
        baseCost *= 10.0f;  // Don't flank when low health
    }
    
    if (action.name == "ThrowGrenade" && !npc.HasClearThrow()) {
        baseCost = INFINITY;  // Can't throw if blocked
    }
    
    return baseCost;
}
```

This created natural prioritization without explicit rules.

### 3. Fail Gracefully

Plans often failed mid-execution (player moved, cover destroyed, etc.). F.E.A.R. handled this:

```cpp
void NPCBrain::Update(float deltaTime) {
    // Execute current action
    if (currentPlan.empty()) {
        // No plan, create new one
        ReplanGoal();
    }
    
    // Check if current action still valid
    Action* currentAction = currentPlan.front();
    
    if (!currentAction->CanExecute(*this)) {
        // Preconditions no longer met, replan
        LogDebug("Action '%s' can't execute, replanning", 
                 currentAction->name.c_str());
        currentPlan.clear();
        ReplanGoal();
        return;
    }
    
    // Check if goal still relevant
    if (ShouldChangeGoal()) {
        LogDebug("Goal changed, abandoning current plan");
        currentPlan.clear();
        currentGoal = SelectNewGoal();
        ReplanGoal();
        return;
    }
    
    // Execute action
    currentAction->Execute(*this);
}
```

**Result:** NPCs adapted naturally to changing circumstances, appearing intelligent and reactive.

## BlueMarble Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core GOAP System (Weeks 1-4)

**Priority: Critical**

1. **Implement Basic Planner**
   - Backward A* search through action space
   - Start with 3-5 state variables (keep it simple)
   - Support for action costs and preconditions/effects

2. **Define Initial Actions for NPCs**
   - Movement: MoveTo, Patrol, Wander
   - Combat: Attack, TakeCover, Retreat
   - Survival: GatherResource, Eat, Sleep

3. **Create Goal System**
   - Goal priority evaluation
   - Goal interruption on urgent events
   - Dynamic goal costs based on NPC needs

**Estimated Effort:** 60-80 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- NPCs can plan 5-10 action sequences
- Planning completes in <5ms for typical scenarios
- NPCs adapt when actions fail

---

### Phase 2: Sensory & Memory (Weeks 5-8)

**Priority: High**

1. **Vision System**
   - FOV cone checking with distance falloff
   - Line-of-sight raycasting
   - Light level consideration (day/night)

2. **Hearing System**
   - Sound propagation with distance attenuation
   - Sound type identification (footsteps, combat, speech)
   - Directional hearing (NPCs turn toward sounds)

3. **Memory System**
   - Last known position tracking
   - Certainty decay over time
   - Threat assessment based on memory

**Estimated Effort:** 40-60 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- NPCs search last known player position
- NPCs investigate sounds realistically
- NPCs forget information over time

---

### Phase 3: Animation Integration (Weeks 9-12)

**Priority: High**

1. **Action-Animation Binding**
   - Each action has associated animation
   - Animation callbacks for game logic timing
   - Smooth transitions between action animations

2. **Animation-Based Constraints**
   - Actions can't execute faster than animations
   - Movement speed matches animation speed
   - Combat timing feels realistic

**Estimated Effort:** 50-70 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- No "teleporting" or instant state changes
- Actions synchronized with visual feedback
- Natural, fluid NPC movement

---

### Phase 4: Communication & Coordination (Weeks 13-16)

**Priority: Medium**

1. **Message Broadcasting System**
   - NPCs broadcast important events
   - Range-limited communication
   - Message priorities and filtering

2. **Reactive Behaviors**
   - Adjust actions based on ally messages
   - Emergent squad tactics
   - Coordinated timing (reloading, advancing)

**Estimated Effort:** 40-50 hours

**Success Metrics:**
- Faction NPCs coordinate attacks
- No central AI controller needed
- Emergent tactical patterns observed

---

### Total Implementation Estimate

**Total Effort:** 190-260 developer hours (5-7 weeks full-time)

**Phased Rollout:**
1. **Alpha:** Core GOAP with basic actions
2. **Beta:** Add sensory/memory systems
3. **Pre-Launch:** Animation integration and polish
4. **Post-Launch:** Communication and advanced tactics

---

## Key Lessons for BlueMarble

### 1. Simplicity Creates Believability

F.E.A.R.'s AI wasn't complex - it was **simple and robust.** Focus on:
- Minimal world state (start with 3-5 variables)
- Small action library (10-20 actions initially)
- Clear action costs and priorities

### 2. Emergent > Scripted

Don't script squad tactics. Instead:
- Give NPCs communication abilities
- Define individual behaviors clearly
- Let tactics emerge from interactions

### 3. Perception Matters More Than Planning

Players judged AI by what it appeared to know, not what it actually knew:
- Realistic sensory limitations
- Visible search behaviors
- Audible callouts and reactions

### 4. Animation IS Gameplay

Tight animation integration made F.E.A.R.'s AI feel grounded:
- Actions take real time (no instant reactions)
- Visual feedback matches game state
- Animations constrain what's possible
