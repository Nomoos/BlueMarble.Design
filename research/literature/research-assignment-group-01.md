## Work Guidelines

### Research Process

1. **Source Review** (30% of time)
   - Read/review source material thoroughly
   - Take structured notes
   - Identify key concepts relevant to BlueMarble

2. **Analysis** (40% of time)
   - Compare with existing BlueMarble systems
   - Identify integration opportunities
   - Evaluate technical feasibility
   - Consider scalability implications

3. **Documentation** (30% of time)
   - Write comprehensive analysis document
   - Include code examples where appropriate
   - Add cross-references to related research
   - Provide clear recommendations

### Document Structure

Each analysis document should include:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and recommendations
2. **Source Overview** - What was analyzed
3. **Core Concepts** - Main ideas and patterns
4. **BlueMarble Application** - How to apply to project
5. **Implementation Recommendations** - Specific action items
6. **References** - Citations and further reading

### Quality Standards
