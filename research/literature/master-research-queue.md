## Processing Strategy

### Current Approach

**Phase 1: Immediate Priority (Now)**
- Process Great Science Textbooks (critical for engineering systems)
- Create detailed extraction guide similar to previous guides
- Focus on practical content extraction for game implementation

**Phase 2: Medium-term Sources (After Phase 1)**
- Military Manuals (logistics and large-scale operations)
- Medical Textbooks (healthcare systems)
- Detailed book analyses for high-priority development books

**Phase 3: Long-term Sources (After Phase 2)**
- Encyclopedia collections
- Communication systems
- Engine-specific and specialized resources

### Processing Format

For each source, create:
1. **Overview**: Source description and relevance
2. **Key Content Areas**: What to extract
3. **Extraction Methodology**: How to process the content
4. **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step application to BlueMarble
5. **Timeline**: Expected completion schedule
6. **Deliverables**: Specific outputs (JSON files, documentation, etc.)

## Progress Tracking

**Session 1 (Current):**
- Starting: Great Science Textbooks Collection
- Expected Output: Detailed extraction guide (600-800 lines)
- Next Update: After completion

**Remaining Work:**
- 26 sources pending detailed analysis
- Estimated total additional documentation: 15,000-20,000 lines
- Estimated time: 3-6 months of focused extraction work

## Notes

- Each source processed individually with stop points for review
- Summary provided after each completion showing remaining work
- Queue can be reordered based on project priorities
- Some sources may be combined or skipped based on relevance
