**Document Type:** Phase 4 Planning Document  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Total Reserved Sources:** 30 (5 from Phase 3 Option 1 + 25 full set)  
**Primary Focus:** Advanced topics, discovered sources, and emerging technologies  
**Status:** Reserved - Awaiting Phase 3 Completion

2. **Full Discovered Set** - All 25 discovered sources as alternative research path
3. **Emerging Technologies** - New discoveries from Phase 3 research
4. **Advanced Specializations** - Deep dives into specific systems

## Reserved Sources from Phase 3 Option 1

When distributing 25 discovered sources into existing Groups 41-46, the following 5 sources were reserved for Phase 4:

### Source 2: "The Invisible Hand of Gaming: F2P Economics" (GDC talks)

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Rationale for Reservation:**

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Rationale for Reservation:**
GW2's horizontal progression is interesting but represents a different progression model than BlueMarble's planned vertical progression. Reserved for Phase 4 when exploring alternative progression systems.

**Phase 4 Application:**
- Alternative progression models
- Trading post design patterns
- Account-wide systems
- Material storage optimization

**Phase 4 Application:**
- Cross-server economic balance
- Guild trader systems
- Regional market variations
- Megaserver architecture patterns

---

### Source 22: "New World: Territory Control Economics"

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Rationale for Reservation:**
New World's specific territory implementation may overlap with other territory sources in Phase 3. Reserved for Phase 4 for comparative territory system analysis.

**Phase 4 Application:**
- Comparative territory analysis
- Town management systems
- Tax system variations
- Economic warfare mechanics

---

### Source 23: "Minecraft: Emergent Economy Analysis"

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Design, Economy  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Rationale for Reservation:**
Minecraft's emergent economy is interesting but represents minimal economic systems. Reserved for Phase 4 when studying emergent player behaviors.

**Phase 4 Application:**
- Emergent economic behaviors
- Minimal economic frameworks
- Player-created systems
- Community-driven markets

---

## Full Discovered Source Set (Alternative)

As an alternative to integration into Phase 3, all 25 discovered sources can be reserved for Phase 4 research. This maintains Phase 3's original scope while providing substantial Phase 4 content.

**Benefits of Full Reservation:**
- Phase 3 remains focused on original 25 sources
- Phase 4 has comprehensive, well-documented sources ready
- Clean separation between foundational (Phase 3) and advanced (Phase 4) research
- Allows Phase 3 discoveries to influence Phase 4 direction

**Phase 4 Assignment Group Structure (If Full Set Reserved):**

### Group 51: Critical Economy Theory (5 sources, 31-42h)
- Sources 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 from discovered set
- Focus: Advanced economic theory and analysis

### Group 52: Modern MMORPG Cases (7 sources, 26-36h)
- Sources 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 19, 22 from discovered set
- Focus: Recent MMORPG economic systems

### Group 53: Extreme Models & Edge Cases (8 sources, 24-33h)
- Sources 3, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25 from discovered set
- Focus: Unusual economic models and lessons

### Group 54: Analytics & Optimization (5 sources, 21-30h)
- Sources 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 from discovered set
- Focus: Technical and analytical approaches
