## Executive Summary

Batch 3 of Phase 2 Group 05 research completed the final two sources focusing on base building mechanics and historical accuracy in game design. These sources provide the capstone for the survival systems research, establishing frameworks for player-constructed spaces and design philosophy that guides implementation of all survival mechanics.

The research demonstrates how construction systems enable player agency and progression while historical accuracy principles ensure authenticity without sacrificing gameplay. Together, these sources complete a comprehensive survival game design framework covering:
- **Player Expression** - Building systems for creativity
- **Design Philosophy** - Balancing realism and fun
- **System Integration** - All survival mechanics working together
- **Educational Value** - Learning through engaging gameplay

**Group 05 Status:** ALL 10 SOURCES COMPLETE ✅
