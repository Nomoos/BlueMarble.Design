- Emergent behaviors arise from simple rule interactions
- Performance optimization is critical for scale
- Balance accessibility with depth

### Player-Centric Design (Sources 1, 2, 3, 10)

- Support multiple play styles and skill levels
- Provide clear feedback for all player actions
- Balance solo and social gameplay
- Respect player time investment

### Geological Survival Integration (All Sources)
