- Load balancing strategies for computational simulation
- Social system architecture supporting guilds, trading, and player interaction

## Core Concepts

### 1. MMORPG Server Architecture

Modern MMORPGs require distributed, scalable server architecture to handle thousands of concurrent players.

#### Architectural Patterns

**Monolithic vs Microservices:**

**Traditional Monolithic Server:**
```
Single Server Process:
├── Login Handler
├── World State Manager
├── Combat System
├── Inventory System
├── Chat System
└── Database Connection Pool
```

**Pros:**
- Simple deployment
- Lower operational complexity
- Easier development initially

**Cons:**
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to scale components independently
- Resource bottlenecks affect entire system

**Modern Microservices Architecture:**
```
Service Mesh:
├── Login Service (Stateless, horizontally scalable)
├── World Service Cluster (Stateful, zone-based sharding)
├── Combat Service (High throughput, event-driven)
├── Inventory Service (ACID transactions, high consistency)
├── Chat Service (High availability, eventual consistency)
├── Economy Service (Transaction processing, anti-fraud)
└── Social Service (Relationships, guilds, friend lists)
```

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling per service
- Fault isolation (one service failure doesn't cascade)
- Technology flexibility (choose best tool per service)
- Easier team organization (ownership per service)

**Cons:**
- Higher operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed transaction challenges
- More complex monitoring and debugging

#### Service Communication Patterns

**Synchronous Communication (Request/Response):**
```
Client → World Service → Inventory Service → Database
                      ← Response ←
```

**Use Cases:**
- Player login (must confirm account state)
- Item trading (requires immediate consistency)
- Critical state changes (death, level up)

**Asynchronous Communication (Events/Messages):**
```
World Service → Event Bus → [Chat Service, Analytics Service, Achievement Service]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Player movement updates (broadcast to nearby players)
- Achievement unlocked (non-blocking notification)
- Analytics events (fire and forget)

**Hybrid Pattern:**
```
Player crafts item:
1. Synchronous: Validate materials and consume them (Inventory Service)
2. Synchronous: Create item with stats (Crafting Service)
3. Asynchronous: Broadcast crafting event (Event Bus)
4. Asynchronous: Update achievements (Achievement Service)
5. Asynchronous: Log for analytics (Analytics Pipeline)
```

#### Server-Side Authority

**Critical Principle: Never Trust the Client**

```
Client Request: "I moved to position (100, 200)"
Server Validation:
1. Is player authenticated?
2. Is destination reachable from current position?
3. Does player have movement ability?
4. Is terrain passable?
5. Are there collision restrictions?
6. Is speed within valid range?

→ If all checks pass: Accept and broadcast
→ If any check fails: Reject and send correction
```

**Authority Boundaries:**

**Server-Authoritative (Must be server-side):**
- Combat damage calculation
- Inventory transactions
- Currency/economy operations
- Quest state progression
- Critical position validation

**Client-Authoritative (Can be client-side with validation):**
- Camera movement
- UI state
- Cosmetic effects
- Audio playback
- Animation blending

**Hybrid (Client predicts, server confirms):**
- Player movement (client predicts, server validates)
- Ability casting (client shows animation, server validates and applies)
- Resource gathering (client starts animation, server validates and rewards)

### 2. Database Design for Persistent Worlds

MMORPG databases must handle massive scale while maintaining consistency for critical operations.

#### Schema Design Patterns

**Player Account Schema:**
```sql
-- Core account data (high consistency required)
CREATE TABLE player_accounts (
    account_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash CHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login TIMESTAMPTZ,
    account_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(20),
    subscription_expires TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_username ON player_accounts(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_email ON player_accounts(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_last_login ON player_accounts(last_login);
```

**Character Data:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE characters (
    character_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id BIGINT REFERENCES player_accounts(account_id),
    character_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    level INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    experience BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    position_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    position_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    zone_id INTEGER,
    health_current INTEGER,
    health_max INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_played TIMESTAMPTZ,
    play_time_seconds BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_characters_account ON characters(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_characters_zone ON characters(zone_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_characters_position ON characters USING gist(
    point(position_x, position_y)
);
```

**Inventory System (EAV Pattern for Flexibility):**
```sql
-- Inventory containers
CREATE TABLE inventory_containers (
    container_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    character_id BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    container_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'backpack', 'bank', 'mailbox'
    slot_capacity INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Inventory items (instances)
CREATE TABLE inventory_items (
    item_instance_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    container_id BIGINT REFERENCES inventory_containers(container_id),
    item_template_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    slot_position INTEGER,
    stack_size INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    durability INTEGER,
    quality_modifier FLOAT,
    is_bound BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    acquired_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Item properties (flexible attributes)
CREATE TABLE item_properties (
    item_instance_id BIGINT REFERENCES inventory_items(item_instance_id),
    property_name VARCHAR(50),
    property_value TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (item_instance_id, property_name)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_items_container ON inventory_items(container_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_items_template ON inventory_items(item_template_id);
```

#### Database Sharding Strategies

**Geographic Sharding (World-Based):**
```
Shard 1: North America Region
  - Players with home position in region bounds
  - Geological data for region
  - Resource nodes for region

Shard 2: Europe Region
  - Players with home position in region bounds
  - Geological data for region
  - Resource nodes for region

Shard 3: Asia Region
  - Players with home position in region bounds
  - Geological data for region
  - Resource nodes for region

Global Shard: Cross-Region Data
  - Player accounts (login anywhere)
  - Global marketplace
  - Guild data
  - Friend lists
```

**Benefits:**
- Query locality (most queries stay within shard)
- Regional latency optimization
- Natural load distribution

**Challenges:**
- Cross-shard player movement (zone transfers)
- Global queries (marketplace, guild roster)
- Data synchronization

**Sharding by Player ID:**
```
Shard 1: Players with ID % 3 == 0
Shard 2: Players with ID % 3 == 1
Shard 3: Players with ID % 3 == 2
```

**Benefits:**
- Even distribution
- Simple routing logic

**Challenges:**
- No locality benefit
- Cross-shard group queries common

**Recommended Hybrid Approach for BlueMarble:**
```
Primary Sharding: Geographic (Geological Zones)
  - Most gameplay stays in region
  - Geological simulation data locality
  - Resource node queries localized

Secondary Sharding: Feature-Based
  - Economy shard (all transactions)
  - Social shard (guilds, friends)
  - Account shard (authentication)
```

#### Database Replication

**Master-Slave Replication:**
```
Master (Write)
  ↓ Replicate
Slave 1 (Read) ←── Query Load Balancer ──→ Slave 2 (Read)
```

**Read/Write Split:**
- All writes go to master
- Reads distributed across slaves
- Accept replication lag for non-critical reads

**Use Cases by Consistency Requirement:**

**Strong Consistency (Master Only):**
- Account login
- Currency transactions
- Item trading
- Critical inventory operations

**Eventual Consistency (Slaves OK):**
- Leaderboards
- Player statistics
- Guild rosters
- Chat history

### 3. Economy Design at Scale

MMORPG economies require careful design to prevent inflation, exploitation, and imbalance.

#### Economic Principles

**Faucets (Money Creation):**
```
Sources of Currency/Resources:
1. Monster Drops
   - Fixed base rates
   - Scaled by monster difficulty
   - Subject to diminishing returns

2. Quest Rewards
   - One-time or daily limits
   - Progression-gated amounts
   - Cannot be repeated for farming

3. Resource Node Respawns
   - Time-based regeneration
   - Shared world resources
   - Scarcity encourages exploration

4. NPC Vendors (Selling Items)
   - Buy prices lower than crafting cost
   - Prevents vendor farming loops
   - Limited by player inventory acquisition
```

**Sinks (Money Destruction):**
```
Drains on Currency/Resources:
1. Repair Costs
   - Equipment degrades with use
   - Encourages careful play
   - Scales with equipment value

2. Crafting Material Consumption
   - Materials destroyed in crafting
   - Failed crafts lose materials
   - Higher tier crafts = more consumption

3. Trading Fees/Taxes
   - Marketplace transaction fees (5-10%)
   - Direct trade taxes
   - Removes currency from economy

4. Consumable Usage
   - Food, potions consumed when used
   - Fast travel costs
   - Teleportation fees

5. Guild/Housing Upkeep
   - Weekly/monthly maintenance costs
   - Premium features require continuous investment
   - Large guilds = significant sink
```

**Balance Equation:**
```
Healthy Economy: Total Faucets ≈ Total Sinks (over time)

If Faucets > Sinks:
  → Inflation
  → Currency becomes worthless
  → Players have too much money
  → High-end items become trivial to buy

If Sinks > Faucets:
  → Deflation
  → Players constantly broke
  → Frustrating progression
  → Trading slows or stops
```

#### Anti-Exploit Mechanisms

**Server-Side Transaction Validation:**
```python
def validate_trade(player_a, player_b, items_a, items_b, gold_a, gold_b):
    # Atomic transaction checks
    checks = [
        # Both players still online and in trade range
        check_players_connected(player_a, player_b),
        check_proximity(player_a, player_b, max_distance=10),
        
        # Items actually exist and owned
        check_items_owned(player_a, items_a),
        check_items_owned(player_b, items_b),
        
        # Items are tradeable (not bound)
        check_items_tradeable(items_a + items_b),
        
        # Gold amounts valid
        check_gold_balance(player_a, gold_a),
        check_gold_balance(player_b, gold_b),
        
        # Inventory space available
        check_inventory_space(player_a, items_b),
        check_inventory_space(player_b, items_a),
        
        # Anti-duplication check
        check_items_not_locked(items_a + items_b),
    ]
    
    if not all(checks):
        return False, "Trade validation failed"
    
    # Execute as database transaction
    with db.transaction():
        # Remove items and gold from source
        remove_items(player_a, items_a)
        remove_gold(player_a, gold_a)
        remove_items(player_b, items_b)
        remove_gold(player_b, gold_b)
        
        # Add items and gold to destination
        add_items(player_b, items_a)
        add_gold(player_b, gold_a)
        add_items(player_a, items_b)
        add_gold(player_a, gold_b)
        
        # Log transaction
        log_trade(player_a, player_b, items_a, items_b, gold_a, gold_b)
    
    return True, "Trade completed"
```

**Rate Limiting:**
```
Prevent Rapid-Fire Exploits:
- Maximum trades per hour: 50
- Maximum marketplace listings per day: 100
- Maximum gold transfer per day: 1,000,000
- Cooldown on resource gathering: 1 second per node
- Quest completion rate limit: 1 per minute
```

**Anomaly Detection:**
```
Monitor for Suspicious Patterns:
1. Sudden wealth increase (possible duplication)
2. Impossible gathering rates (bot detection)
3. Repeated failed trade attempts (exploit testing)
4. High-value one-sided trades (gold selling)
5. Rapid item crafting (macro detection)

Response Actions:
- Flag account for review
- Temporary trade restrictions
- Economy audit trail investigation
- Rollback capabilities for exploited items
```

#### Marketplace Design

**Auction House Architecture:**
```sql
-- Listings
CREATE TABLE marketplace_listings (
    listing_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    seller_character_id BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    item_instance_id BIGINT REFERENCES inventory_items(item_instance_id),
    asking_price BIGINT NOT NULL,
    listing_fee BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' -- 'active', 'sold', 'expired', 'cancelled'
);

-- Bidding (optional for auction-style)
CREATE TABLE marketplace_bids (
    bid_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    listing_id BIGINT REFERENCES marketplace_listings(listing_id),
    bidder_character_id BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    bid_amount BIGINT NOT NULL,
    bid_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Transaction history
CREATE TABLE marketplace_transactions (
    transaction_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    listing_id BIGINT REFERENCES marketplace_listings(listing_id),
    seller_character_id BIGINT,
    buyer_character_id BIGINT,
    item_instance_id BIGINT,
    sale_price BIGINT,
    marketplace_fee BIGINT,
    transaction_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_listings_status ON marketplace_listings(status, expires_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_item_template ON marketplace_listings(item_instance_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_seller ON marketplace_transactions(seller_character_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_buyer ON marketplace_transactions(buyer_character_id);
```

**Search and Filter Optimization:**
```
Materialized Views for Common Queries:
- Items by category (weapons, armor, resources)
- Items by quality tier
- Recent price history per item type
- Most traded items (volume)

Caching Strategy:
- Cache top 100 most searched items (Redis)
- Cache recent price history (last 24 hours)
- Cache aggregate statistics (average prices)
- Cache user's active listings
- TTL: 5-15 minutes depending on data volatility
```

### 4. Load Balancing and Scalability

Distributing computational load across servers to handle thousands of concurrent players.

#### Zone-Based Load Distribution

**World Division Strategy:**
```
World Grid System:
Zone 0,0 → Server 1
Zone 0,1 → Server 1
Zone 1,0 → Server 2
Zone 1,1 → Server 2
Zone 2,0 → Server 3
Zone 2,1 → Server 3

Dynamic Assignment:
- Monitor player density per zone
- Migrate high-population zones to dedicated servers
- Balance geological simulation load
```

**Zone Transfer Protocol:**
```
Player crosses zone boundary (100, 200) → (101, 200):

Source Server (Zone 0,0):
1. Serialize player state (position, inventory, buffs, quests)
2. Lock player state (prevent duplicates)
3. Send transfer packet to destination server
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Remove player from local world state
6. Unlock player state

Destination Server (Zone 1,0):
1. Receive transfer packet
2. Validate player data integrity
3. Check for existing player instance (prevent duplicates)
4. Instantiate player in new zone
5. Send confirmation to source server
6. Notify nearby players of new arrival
7. Send world state to transferring player

Client:
1. Display "Transferring to new zone..." message
2. Disconnect from source server
3. Connect to destination server
4. Load new zone assets
5. Resume gameplay

Error Handling:
- Transfer timeout: Return player to source zone
- Destination server unavailable: Queue transfer, return to source
- State corruption: Log error, use backup state, notify player
```

#### Computational Load Management

**Geological Simulation Optimization:**
```
Challenge: Real-time geological simulation is CPU-intensive

Solution: Tiered Simulation Detail

Tier 1: Active Gameplay Zones (High Detail)
- Full geological simulation
- Real-time terrain deformation
- Detailed resource node updates
- Active player count: 10-50 per zone
- Update frequency: Every game tick (50-100ms)

Tier 2: Adjacent Zones (Medium Detail)
- Simplified simulation
- Aggregate terrain changes
- Periodic resource updates
- Player count: 0 (but near active players)
- Update frequency: Every 5 seconds

Tier 3: Distant Zones (Low Detail)
- Minimal simulation
- State preservation only
- No active updates
- Player count: 0
- Update frequency: Every hour

Tier 4: Hibernated Zones (No Simulation)
- Complete freeze
- State stored in database
- No computational cost
- Player count: 0, no recent activity
- Update frequency: None (event-driven only)
```

**Dynamic LOD Adjustment:**
```python
def adjust_simulation_detail(zone, player_count, cpu_load):
    if cpu_load > 80:  # Server overloaded
        if player_count == 0:
            hibernate_zone(zone)
        elif player_count < 5:
            reduce_to_tier_2(zone)
        else:
            optimize_critical_systems(zone)
    
    elif cpu_load < 40:  # Server underutilized
        if player_count > 0:
            upgrade_to_tier_1(zone)
        elif has_adjacent_active_zones(zone):
            upgrade_to_tier_2(zone)
    
    # Maintain Tier 1 for any zone with players
    if player_count > 0 and zone.tier != 1:
        upgrade_to_tier_1(zone)
```

#### Horizontal Scaling Patterns

**Stateless Services (Easy to Scale):**
```
Login Service:
- No state between requests
- Add more instances as needed
- Load balancer distributes evenly
- Scale up/down based on login rate

API Gateway:
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Add instances for throughput
- No session affinity required
```

**Stateful Services (Complex to Scale):**
```
World Service:
- Maintains active player state
- Requires session affinity (sticky sessions)
- Cannot easily migrate players mid-session
- Scale by adding more world zones to new servers

Strategy:
1. Assign zones to specific servers
2. New servers handle new zones or less populated zones
3. Migrate zones during low-traffic periods
4. Use zone transfer protocol for player migration
```

### 5. Social Systems Architecture

Enabling player interaction, guilds, trading, and community features at scale.

#### Guild/Clan System Design

**Guild Data Model:**
```sql
-- Guild core data
CREATE TABLE guilds (
    guild_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    guild_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    guild_tag VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    description TEXT,
    max_members INTEGER DEFAULT 50,
    guild_bank_gold BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    guild_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    guild_experience BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Guild membership
CREATE TABLE guild_members (
    member_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    guild_id BIGINT REFERENCES guilds(guild_id),
    character_id BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    rank VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'member',
    joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    contribution_points BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    last_online TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE(guild_id, character_id)
);

-- Guild ranks and permissions
CREATE TABLE guild_ranks (
    rank_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    guild_id BIGINT REFERENCES guilds(guild_id),
    rank_name VARCHAR(50),
    rank_level INTEGER, -- 0 = leader, 10 = lowest
    can_invite BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    can_remove BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    can_edit_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    can_access_bank BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    can_withdraw_gold BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    max_daily_gold_withdrawal BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_guild_members_guild ON guild_members(guild_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_guild_members_character ON guild_members(character_id);
```

**Guild Operations (Server-Side):**
```python
class GuildService:
    def create_guild(self, founder_character_id, guild_name, guild_tag):
        # Validation
        if not self.validate_guild_name(guild_name):
            return False, "Invalid guild name"
        
        if self.get_character_guild(founder_character_id):
            return False, "Character already in guild"
        
        # Check creation cost
        if not self.has_gold(founder_character_id, GUILD_CREATION_COST):
            return False, "Insufficient gold"
        
        # Create guild
        with db.transaction():
            guild_id = db.create_guild(guild_name, guild_tag)
            db.create_guild_rank(guild_id, "Leader", level=0, all_permissions=True)
            db.create_guild_rank(guild_id, "Officer", level=1, invite=True, manage=True)
            db.create_guild_rank(guild_id, "Member", level=2, bank_access=True)
            db.add_guild_member(guild_id, founder_character_id, rank="Leader")
            db.remove_gold(founder_character_id, GUILD_CREATION_COST)
            
        return True, guild_id
    
    def invite_to_guild(self, inviter_character_id, target_character_id):
        # Check permissions
        inviter_guild = self.get_character_guild(inviter_character_id)
        if not inviter_guild:
            return False, "Not in guild"
        
        if not self.has_permission(inviter_character_id, "can_invite"):
            return False, "Insufficient permissions"
        
        # Check target eligibility
        if self.get_character_guild(target_character_id):
            return False, "Target already in guild"
        
        # Send invite (expires in 5 minutes)
        invite_id = db.create_guild_invite(
            inviter_guild.id,
            target_character_id,
            expires_at=now() + timedelta(minutes=5)
        )
        
        # Notify target player
        send_notification(target_character_id, "guild_invite", {
            "guild_id": inviter_guild.id,
            "guild_name": inviter_guild.name,
            "inviter": inviter_character_id,
            "invite_id": invite_id
        })
        
        return True, invite_id
```

#### Friend System

**Friend Data Model:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE friend_relationships (
    relationship_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    character_id_1 BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    character_id_2 BIGINT REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    status VARCHAR(20), -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'blocked'
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    CHECK (character_id_1 < character_id_2) -- Prevent duplicate relationships
);

CREATE INDEX idx_friends_char1 ON friend_relationships(character_id_1, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_friends_char2 ON friend_relationships(character_id_2, status);
```

**Online Status Tracking:**
```
Challenge: How to efficiently track which friends are online?

Solution: Presence Service with Redis

Redis Data Structure:
Key: "online_players"
Type: Sorted Set
Score: Last heartbeat timestamp
Members: Character IDs

Operations:
- Player logs in: ZADD online_players <timestamp> <character_id>
- Heartbeat (every 30s): ZADD online_players <timestamp> <character_id>
- Check online: ZSCORE online_players <character_id>
- Get online friends: ZRANGEBYSCORE + friend list intersection
- Cleanup stale: ZREMRANGEBYSCORE online_players 0 <5_minutes_ago>

Scaling:
- Redis cluster for sharding
- Pub/Sub for real-time online/offline notifications
- Broadcast to friend lists when status changes
```

#### Chat System Architecture

**Channel Types:**
```
Global Channels (High Volume):
- World Chat: All players
- Trade Chat: Economy focused
- Help Chat: Questions and answers

Regional Channels (Medium Volume):
- Zone Chat: Players in same geological zone
- Proximity Chat: Players within range

Private Channels (Low Volume):
- Whispers: 1-to-1 direct messages
- Guild Chat: Guild members only
- Party Chat: Group members only
```

**Message Flow:**
```
Client sends message → World Server → Chat Service

Chat Service:
1. Validate message (length, profanity filter, rate limit)
2. Determine recipients based on channel
3. Publish to message queue (Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ)
4. Subscribers receive and forward to clients

Message Queue Topics:
- chat.global
- chat.zone.<zone_id>
- chat.guild.<guild_id>
- chat.whisper.<character_id>

Scaling:
- Chat service stateless (can scale horizontally)
- Message queue handles distribution
- Clients subscribe to relevant topics
- History stored in database (last 100 messages per channel)
```

**Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**
```
Rate Limits:
- Global chat: 1 message per 3 seconds
- Zone chat: 1 message per 2 seconds
- Whisper: 5 messages per 10 seconds
- Guild chat: 1 message per second

Profanity Filter:
- Dictionary-based word matching
- Pattern recognition (l33t speak, spacing)
- Contextual analysis (ML-based for advanced)

Reporting and Moderation:
- Players can report messages
- Automatic temporary mute after X reports
- Human moderator review queue
- Escalating punishment (mute → temp ban → permanent ban)
```

Support: 100-500 concurrent players
```

**Phase 3: Distributed Architecture (Launch)**
```
Full Scale-Out:
- Geographic sharding (multiple world regions)
- Load balancers for stateless services
- Database replication (master + read replicas)
- CDN for static assets
- Message queue for events

Support: 1000+ concurrent players
```

### Database Schema for BlueMarble

**Geological Data Extensions:**
```sql
-- Geological zones with simulation state
CREATE TABLE geological_zones (
    zone_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    zone_name VARCHAR(100),
    bounds_min_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    bounds_min_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    bounds_max_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    bounds_max_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    simulation_tier INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    active_player_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_simulation_tick TIMESTAMPTZ,
    server_instance_id INTEGER
);

-- Resource nodes with respawn tracking
CREATE TABLE resource_nodes (
    node_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    zone_id INTEGER REFERENCES geological_zones(zone_id),
    resource_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'iron_ore', 'copper_vein', 'coal_deposit'
    position_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    position_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    quantity_current INTEGER,
    quantity_max INTEGER,
    quality_tier INTEGER,
    last_harvested_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    respawn_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    geology_properties JSONB -- Flexible geological attributes
);

CREATE INDEX idx_resource_nodes_zone ON resource_nodes(zone_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_resource_nodes_position ON resource_nodes USING gist(
    point(position_x, position_y)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_resource_nodes_respawn ON resource_nodes(respawn_at) 
    WHERE quantity_current < quantity_max;
```

### Economy Design for BlueMarble

**Resource-Based Economy:**
```
Faucets:
1. Geological Resource Extraction
   - Mining ore veins
   - Quarrying stone
   - Harvesting crystals
   - Drilling for oil/gas

2. Geological Events
   - Earthquakes expose new resources
   - Volcanic eruptions create rare materials
   - Erosion reveals deposits
   - Plate tectonics shift resource locations

Sinks:
1. Tool Durability
   - Geological tools wear down
   - Harder materials = faster wear
   - Repairs require materials + currency

2. Refining Losses
   - Ore → Metal conversion inefficiency
   - Quality-dependent yield
   - Failed refining consumes resources

3. Construction Costs
   - Buildings require materials
   - Advanced structures need rare resources
   - Maintenance over time

4. Geological Hazards
   - Earthquakes damage structures
   - Floods erode resources
   - Natural disasters = repair costs
```

**Marketplace for Geological Resources:**
```
Categories:
- Raw Ores (Iron, Copper, Gold, etc.)
- Refined Metals
- Gemstones and Crystals
- Construction Materials (Stone, Wood, Clay)
- Specialized Geological Tools
- Rare Geological Samples

Pricing Dynamics:
- Supply affected by resource node availability
- Demand driven by construction projects
- Geological events create supply shocks
- Player specialization creates trade niches
```

### Load Balancing for Geological Simulation

**Zone Assignment Strategy:**
```
Low Activity Zones (Tier 3-4):
- Minimal simulation
- 1-2 zones per server instance
- Quick activation when players approach

Medium Activity Zones (Tier 2):
- Moderate simulation
- 1 zone per server instance
- Adjacent to active player zones

High Activity Zones (Tier 1):
- Full geological simulation
- Dedicated server instance
- 10+ concurrent players
- Real-time terrain deformation
```

**Dynamic Rebalancing:**
```python
def rebalance_zones():
    zones = get_all_zones()
    
    for zone in zones:
        if zone.active_player_count > 50:
            # Too many players, consider splitting
            if can_split_zone(zone):
                split_zone_across_servers(zone)
        
        elif zone.active_player_count == 0 and zone.tier == 1:
            # No players, reduce simulation detail
            downgrade_zone_tier(zone, new_tier=3)
        
        elif zone.active_player_count > 0 and zone.tier > 1:
            # Players in low-detail zone, upgrade
            upgrade_zone_tier(zone, new_tier=1)
```
