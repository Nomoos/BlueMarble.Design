## ü§ñ Copilot Worker Instructions

**File to Process:** `research/literature/research-assignment-group-{NUMBER}.md`

Replace `{NUMBER}` with your assigned group number (01-40).

### Your Task

You are a research assistant working on **Research Assignment Group {NUMBER}**. Your job is to:

1. **Read and analyze** the sources listed in your assignment file
2. **Create comprehensive research documents** based on your analysis
3. **Log any new sources** you discover during your research
4. **Save all work** to the repository in the correct format

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Phase 1: Locate Your Assignment

```bash
# Navigate to your assignment file
cd /home/runner/work/BlueMarble.Design/BlueMarble.Design
cat research/literature/research-assignment-group-{NUMBER}.md
```

#### Phase 2: Read Source Material

1. **Identify your topics** in the "Topics" section of your assignment file
2. **Read the source material** for each topic:
   - For books: Read chapters/sections relevant to focus areas
   - For online resources: Review documentation, code examples, tutorials
   - For code repositories: Analyze architecture, patterns, implementations
3. **Take structured notes** as you read:
   - Key concepts and patterns
   - Code examples worth highlighting
   - Implementation recommendations
   - Related sources discovered

#### Phase 3: Create Research Documents

For each topic in your assignment, create a new file:

**File Location:** `research/literature/`  
**File Name:** Use kebab-case based on topic:
- Game development topics: `game-dev-analysis-{topic-name}.md`
- Survival content topics: `survival-content-extraction-{topic-name}.md`
- Other topics: `{category}-{topic-name}.md`

**Document Structure:**

```markdown

title: [Topic Title]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
tags: [research, analysis, {category}, {priority}]
status: completed
source: [Original source reference]

**Document Status:** Complete  
**Word Count:** [Approximate count]  
**Lines:** [Approximate line count]  
**Quality Check:** ‚úÖ Meets minimum length requirements
```

#### Phase 4: Log Discovered Sources

**Important:** As you research, you'll discover new sources. Log them in TWO places:

1. **In your research document** (as shown above in "Discovered Sources" section)
2. **In your assignment file** under "New Sources Discovery" section

**Format for assignment file:**

```markdown
### Discovered Sources Log

**Source Name:** [Title of discovered source]  
**Discovered From:** [Which topic/analysis led to this]  
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low - your assessment]  
**Category:** [GameDev-Tech/GameDev-Design/GameDev-Content/Survival/etc.]  
**Rationale:** [Why this source is relevant to BlueMarble]  
**Estimated Effort:** [X-Y hours needed for analysis]  
**Reference:** [URL or citation]

---
```

#### Phase 5: Update Progress Tracking

In your assignment file (`research-assignment-group-{NUMBER}.md`), update the "Progress Tracking" section:

```markdown
## Progress Tracking

- [x] [Topic 1 name] - Completed [YYYY-MM-DD]
- [ ] [Topic 2 name] - In Progress
- [x] All documents created and placed in `research/literature/`
- [x] All documents have proper front matter
- [x] Discovered sources logged
```

#### Phase 6: Save and Submit

1. **Verify all files are in correct location:**
   ```bash
   ls -la research/literature/game-dev-analysis-*.md
   ls -la research/literature/survival-content-extraction-*.md
   ```

2. **Check file naming (kebab-case):**
   - ‚úÖ Good: `game-dev-analysis-multiplayer-programming.md`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `Game_Dev_Analysis_Multiplayer_Programming.md`

3. **Verify front matter in each document:**
   ```bash
   head -10 research/literature/[your-file].md
   ```

4. **Commit your work:**
   - All research documents should be in `research/literature/`
   - Assignment file should be updated with progress and discoveries
   - Use descriptive commit messages

### Quality Checklist

Before marking your work complete, verify:

- [ ] ‚úÖ All topics from assignment file researched
- [ ] ‚úÖ Each topic has a dedicated analysis document
- [ ] ‚úÖ All documents in `research/literature/` directory
- [ ] ‚úÖ All documents use kebab-case naming
- [ ] ‚úÖ All documents have YAML front matter
- [ ] ‚úÖ Documents meet minimum length requirements (see assignment file)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Code examples included where relevant
- [ ] ‚úÖ Citations and references properly formatted
- [ ] ‚úÖ Cross-references added to related documents
- [ ] ‚úÖ Discovered sources logged in both places
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress tracking updated in assignment file
- [ ] ‚úÖ BlueMarble-specific recommendations included

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip source discovery logging** - This is critical for Phase 2 planning
2. **Don't use title case in filenames** - Always use kebab-case
3. **Don't forget YAML front matter** - It's required for all documents
4. **Don't create generic summaries** - Include specific, actionable recommendations
5. **Don't ignore minimum length requirements** - They vary by priority level
6. **Don't forget code examples** - Include them for technical topics
7. **Don't work in isolation** - Add cross-references to related research

### File Naming Examples

**Game Development Topics:**
- `game-dev-analysis-multiplayer-programming.md`
- `game-dev-analysis-network-architecture.md`
- `game-dev-analysis-rendering-pipelines.md`

**Survival Content Topics:**
- `survival-content-extraction-medical-systems.md`
- `survival-content-extraction-crafting-recipes.md`
- `survival-content-extraction-technology-trees.md`

**Other Topics:**
- `design-patterns-mmorpg-architecture.md`
- `algorithm-analysis-pathfinding-systems.md`
- `tools-analysis-development-workflows.md`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check examples:**
   - `research/literature/example-topic.md` - Format example
   - `research/literature/game-dev-analysis-01-game-programming-cpp.md` - Complete example

2. **Review guidelines:**
   - `research/literature/README.md` - General guidelines
   - `research/literature/research-assignment-groups-overview.md` - Overview
   - `research/literature/phase-1-research-note.md` - Phase 1 coordination

3. **Check templates:**
   - `templates/research-note.md` - Research note template
   - `templates/research-report.md` - Research report template

### Automation Tips for Copilot Workers

```bash
# 1. Navigate to repository
cd /home/runner/work/BlueMarble.Design/BlueMarble.Design

# 2. Read your assignment
export GROUP_NUM="01"  # Change to your group number
cat research/literature/research-assignment-group-${GROUP_NUM}.md

# 3. List topics in your assignment
grep "^### " research/literature/research-assignment-group-${GROUP_NUM}.md

# 4. Create your first research document
touch research/literature/game-dev-analysis-[topic-name].md

# 5. Check progress
grep "^- \[" research/literature/research-assignment-group-${GROUP_NUM}.md
```
