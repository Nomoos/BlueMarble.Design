## Core Concepts

### 1. Network Protocol Fundamentals

#### TCP vs UDP Trade-offs

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
- **Guarantees:** Ordered, reliable delivery
- **Use Cases:** 
  - Account authentication and login
  - Inventory transactions
  - Chat messages
  - Critical state changes (player death, level up)
- **Drawbacks:** 
  - Head-of-line blocking causes stuttering
  - Retransmission delays affect real-time feel
  - Higher overhead per packet

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
- **Guarantees:** None - fire and forget
- **Use Cases:**
  - Player position updates
  - Projectile trajectory
  - Environmental audio
  - Non-critical visual effects
- **Benefits:**
  - Low latency
  - No blocking on packet loss
  - Minimal protocol overhead
- **Challenges:**
  - Must implement custom reliability where needed
  - Packet loss and reordering must be handled

**Hybrid Approach (Industry Standard):**
```
Critical Data → Reliable Ordered Channel (TCP-like over UDP)
Position Updates → Unreliable Unordered Channel (Raw UDP)
Important Events → Reliable Unordered Channel (Custom UDP)
```

**Example Protocol Stack:**
```
Application Layer: Game State Messages
├── Reliability Layer: Selective acknowledgment, sequencing
├── Channel Layer: Multiple logical streams
├── Fragmentation Layer: Handle large messages
└── Transport Layer: UDP sockets
```

#### ENet and Custom Solutions

**ENet Library Features:**
- Reliable UDP with selective acknowledgment
- Multiple channels (mix reliable/unreliable)
- Packet sequencing and ordering
- Automatic fragmentation/reassembly
- Connection management

**When to Use Custom Protocols:**
- Extreme optimization requirements (fighting games)
- Non-traditional network topologies (peer-to-peer mesh)
- Special hardware or platform constraints
- Research or educational purposes

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**
Start with proven library (ENet or RakNet) for development velocity. Optimize custom protocol only if profiling reveals it as bottleneck.

### 2. Client Prediction and Server Reconciliation

#### The Latency Problem

With typical internet latency (30-100ms), waiting for server confirmation creates unacceptable input lag:

```
Player Presses "W" → 50ms to server → Server processes → 50ms to client
Total delay: 100ms+ before seeing movement = Unplayable
```

#### Client-Side Prediction Solution

**Algorithm:**
1. Player input occurs (e.g., "move forward")
2. Client immediately applies movement locally (prediction)
3. Client sends input command to server with timestamp
4. Server processes input with same logic
5. Server sends authoritative result back
6. Client reconciles prediction with server truth

**Implementation Pattern:**
```cpp
// Client-side prediction
void Client::ProcessInput(Input input) {
    // Store input with sequence number
    pendingInputs.push_back({input, currentSequence++});
    
    // Apply locally for immediate feedback
    ApplyInput(input, localPlayerState);
    
    // Send to server
    SendInputToServer(input, currentSequence);
}

// Server reconciliation
void Client::OnServerUpdate(ServerState serverState) {
    // Server confirms state at sequence N
    int confirmedSequence = serverState.lastProcessedInput;
    
    // Remove confirmed inputs
    RemoveInputsUpTo(confirmedSequence);
    
    // Reset to server authoritative state
    localPlayerState = serverState.playerState;
    
    // Re-apply pending (unconfirmed) inputs
    for (auto& input : pendingInputs) {
        ApplyInput(input.command, localPlayerState);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero perceived input lag
- Server remains authoritative (anti-cheat)
- Prediction errors corrected smoothly

**Challenges:**
- Mispredictions cause rubber-banding
- Increased client CPU usage
- More complex implementation

#### Server Reconciliation Strategies

**Full State Reconciliation:**
- Server sends complete player state
- Client discards local prediction entirely
- Simple but bandwidth-intensive

**Delta Compression:**
- Server sends only what changed
- Client merges with predicted state
- Efficient but complex error handling

**Snapshot Interpolation:**
- Server sends snapshots at fixed intervals (e.g., 20 times/second)
- Client interpolates between snapshots
- Other players lag slightly but move smoothly

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Local Player: Client prediction + server reconciliation
Other Players: Snapshot interpolation (100ms delay acceptable)
NPCs: Server-authoritative updates (less critical responsiveness)
Geological Events: Snapshot-based (not real-time critical)
```

### 3. Lag Compensation

#### The Core Problem

With client prediction, players see the world slightly differently based on latency. Example:

```
Player A latency: 30ms (sees game state from 30ms ago)
Player B latency: 100ms (sees game state from 100ms ago)

When Player B shoots at Player A:
- B sees A at position X (100ms ago)
- Server sees A at position Y (current)
- Did the shot hit?
```

#### Rewind-and-Replay Technique

**Algorithm:**
1. Client sends action (e.g., "fire weapon") with timestamp
2. Server rewinds world state to that timestamp
3. Server performs hit detection in that historical state
4. Server applies results in current time
5. Server broadcasts results to all clients

**Implementation Concept:**
```cpp
struct WorldSnapshot {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    std::map<PlayerId, PlayerState> playerStates;
    // Other relevant world state
};

class LagCompensator {
private:
    std::deque<WorldSnapshot> history; // Ring buffer of past states
    
public:
    // Store snapshots at regular intervals
    void StoreSnapshot(WorldSnapshot snapshot) {
        history.push_back(snapshot);
        // Keep last 1 second of history
        while (history.size() > 60) { // 60fps = 1 second
            history.pop_front();
        }
    }
    
    // Execute action at historical time
    HitResult ProcessActionAtTime(PlayerId shooter, 
                                   Action action, 
                                   uint32_t clientTime) {
        // Find snapshot closest to client time
        WorldSnapshot& historical = FindSnapshot(clientTime);
        
        // Perform hit detection in that state
        return PerformHitDetection(historical, shooter, action);
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Fair for high-latency players
- Shots hit where player aimed
- Consistent experience across latencies

**Challenges:**
- Memory overhead (storing history)
- "Shot around corner" phenomenon
- Complex debugging and validation

#### Interpolation Delay

**Technique:**
For remote entities, add artificial delay to smooth out jitter:

```cpp
void RenderRemotePlayer(RemotePlayer& player) {
    uint32_t interpolationTime = currentTime - 100ms;
    
    // Find snapshots before and after interpolation time
    Snapshot& before = FindSnapshot(interpolationTime - dt);
    Snapshot& after = FindSnapshot(interpolationTime + dt);
    
    // Interpolate position between snapshots
    float t = (interpolationTime - before.time) / 
              (after.time - before.time);
    
    Vector3 position = Lerp(before.position, after.position, t);
    
    RenderAt(position);
}
```

**Trade-off:**
- Remote players render 100ms behind "reality"
- But movement appears smooth, not jittery
- Acceptable for MMORPG (not competitive FPS)

### 4. Interest Management

#### The Scalability Challenge

**Problem Statement:**
On a planet with 10,000 concurrent players:
- Cannot send every player's state to every other player
- 10,000 * 10,000 = 100 million updates per tick = Impossible

**Solution:**
Only send relevant information to each player based on their area of interest.

#### Spatial Partitioning Techniques

**Grid-Based Partitioning:**
```
Divide world into grid cells (e.g., 100m x 100m)
Track which players/entities are in each cell
Player receives updates only from their cell + adjacent cells

Example:
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  A  │  B  │  C  │  Player in cell E
├─────┼─────┼─────┤  Receives updates from: B, D, E, F, H
│  D  │  E  │  F  │  Does not receive: A, C, G, I
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  G  │  H  │  I  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

**Implementation:**
```cpp
class SpatialGrid {
    struct Cell {
        std::set<EntityId> entities;
    };
    
    std::map<GridCoord, Cell> cells;
    int cellSize = 100; // meters
    
    GridCoord GetCell(Vector3 position) {
        return {position.x / cellSize, position.y / cellSize};
    }
    
    std::vector<EntityId> GetNearbyEntities(Vector3 position) {
        GridCoord center = GetCell(position);
        std::vector<EntityId> nearby;
        
        // Check 3x3 grid of cells
        for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
            for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
                GridCoord coord = {center.x + dx, center.y + dy};
                nearby.insert(nearby.end(), 
                             cells[coord].entities.begin(),
                             cells[coord].entities.end());
            }
        }
        return nearby;
    }
};
```

**Quadtree/Octree Approach:**
- Hierarchical spatial structure
- Adapts to entity density
- Better for uneven distribution
- More complex implementation

**BlueMarble Choice:**
Start with grid (simpler), profile, upgrade to quadtree if hotspots emerge.

#### Area of Interest (AOI) Algorithms

**Fixed Radius AOI:**
```cpp
// Simple: All entities within 500m radius
std::vector<EntityId> GetAOI(Vector3 playerPos) {
    std::vector<EntityId> visible;
    for (auto& entity : GetNearbyEntities(playerPos)) {
        if (Distance(playerPos, entity.position) < 500.0f) {
            visible.push_back(entity.id);
        }
    }
    return visible;
}
```

**Priority-Based Updates:**
```cpp
// Update frequency based on distance
struct UpdatePriority {
    EntityId entity;
    float priority; // Closer = higher priority
};

void SendUpdates(Player& player) {
    auto entities = GetAOI(player.position);
    
    // Calculate priorities
    std::vector<UpdatePriority> priorities;
    for (auto& entity : entities) {
        float dist = Distance(player.position, entity.position);
        float priority = 1.0f / (dist + 1.0f); // Inverse distance
        priorities.push_back({entity, priority});
    }
    
    // Sort by priority
    std::sort(priorities.begin(), priorities.end(),
              [](auto& a, auto& b) { return a.priority > b.priority; });
    
    // Send top N updates per tick
    int budget = 50; // Updates per tick
    for (int i = 0; i < min(budget, priorities.size()); i++) {
        SendEntityUpdate(player, priorities[i].entity);
    }
}
```

**Visibility Testing:**
- Raycasting for line-of-sight
- Frustum culling (only visible on screen)
- Height/terrain occlusion

**BlueMarble Application:**
```
Tier 1 (0-100m): Full updates, 20 Hz
Tier 2 (100-500m): Reduced updates, 5 Hz
Tier 3 (500m+): Minimal updates, 1 Hz
Out of Range: No updates, notify on enter range
```

### 5. State Synchronization Models

#### Full State Synchronization

**Approach:**
Server sends complete game state to all clients periodically.

**Pros:**
- Simple implementation
- Self-correcting (lost packets don't accumulate)
- Easy debugging

**Cons:**
- High bandwidth usage
- Doesn't scale to large worlds

**Use Cases:**
- Small multiplayer games (2-8 players)
- Turn-based games
- Simple prototypes

#### Delta State Synchronization

**Approach:**
Server sends only what changed since last update.

**Implementation:**
```cpp
struct EntityState {
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 velocity;
    float health;
    // ... other properties
    
    uint32_t lastUpdateSequence; // Track what client knows
};

// Generate delta update
DeltaUpdate GenerateDelta(EntityState& current, 
                          EntityState& clientKnownState) {
    DeltaUpdate delta;
    
    if (current.position != clientKnownState.position) {
        delta.AddChange("position", current.position);
    }
    if (current.health != clientKnownState.health) {
        delta.AddChange("health", current.health);
    }
    // Only send what changed
    
    return delta;
}
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal bandwidth
- Scales to many entities

**Cons:**
- Complex state tracking
- Packet loss requires recovery mechanism
- Stateful protocol

#### Event-Based Synchronization

**Approach:**
Server broadcasts discrete events, clients apply them.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Server-side events
enum EventType {
    PLAYER_MOVED,
    ENTITY_SPAWNED,
    ENTITY_DESTROYED,
    DAMAGE_DEALT,
    ITEM_COLLECTED
};

struct GameEvent {
    EventType type;
    uint32_t sequence;
    uint32_t timestamp;
    // Event-specific data
};

// Client processes event stream
void Client::ProcessEvent(GameEvent& event) {
    switch (event.type) {
        case PLAYER_MOVED:
            UpdatePlayerPosition(event.playerId, event.newPosition);
            break;
        case DAMAGE_DEALT:
            ApplyDamage(event.targetId, event.amount);
            SpawnDamageEffect(event.position);
            break;
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Efficient for sparse changes
- Natural replay/recording capability
- Deterministic (good for lockstep)

**Cons:**
- Requires reliable event delivery
- Events can arrive out of order
- Harder to reason about state

**BlueMarble Hybrid Model:**
```
Frequent updates (position): Delta state synchronization
Important events (combat): Event-based with reliability
World state (geology): Snapshot-based, low frequency
```

### 6. Distributed Server Architecture

#### Single-Server Limitations

**Maximum Players on Single Server:**
- Network bandwidth: ~1000-2000 concurrent players
- CPU (physics, AI): ~500-1000 players
- World size: Limited by single process memory

**BlueMarble Scale Requirement:**
Planetary simulation with 10,000+ concurrent players requires distribution.

#### Zone-Based Architecture

**Concept:**
Divide world into zones, each managed by separate server process.

```
Planet Surface:
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  Zone 1     │  Zone 2     │  Zone 3     │
│  Server A   │  Server B   │  Server C   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  Zone 4     │  Zone 5     │  Zone 6     │
│  Server D   │  Server E   │  Server F   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

Each zone server handles:
- Players in that geographic region
- NPCs and entities in zone
- Local physics simulation
- Database writes for zone
```

**Zone Transition Protocol:**
```cpp
// Player moving from Zone 1 to Zone 2
void HandleZoneTransition(Player& player) {
    // 1. Zone 1 detects player near boundary
    if (PlayerNearBoundary(player)) {
        NotifyBoundaryServer(player.id, player.position);
    }
    
    // 2. Zone 2 receives notification, prepares handoff
    void Zone2::PrepareHandoff(PlayerId id, Vector3 pos) {
        reservedSlots.insert(id);
        PreloadPlayerData(id);
    }
    
    // 3. Player crosses boundary
    // Zone 1 sends complete player state to Zone 2
    void Zone1::TransferPlayer(PlayerId id) {
        PlayerState state = GetPlayerState(id);
        Zone2::ReceivePlayer(id, state);
        RemovePlayer(id); // Zone 1 no longer manages
    }
    
    // 4. Client receives redirect
    void Client::OnZoneTransfer(ServerAddress newZone) {
        DisconnectFrom(currentZone);
        ConnectTo(newZone);
        // Seamless transition for player
    }
}
```

**Challenges:**
- Seamless transitions (no disconnect)
- Border synchronization
- Load balancing across zones
- Cross-zone communication (chat, trading)

#### Layered Server Architecture

**Architecture Layers:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Load Balancer / Connection Manager     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Game World Servers (Stateful)          │
│  - Zone 1, Zone 2, ..., Zone N          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Shared Services (Stateless)            │
│  - Authentication, Chat, Social, Market │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Database Cluster (Persistent State)    │
│  - Player data, World state, Analytics  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Microservices Decomposition:**
```
Frontend:
- Connection Manager (WebSocket/TCP gateway)
- Load Balancer (distribute to zone servers)

Game Logic:
- Zone Servers (world simulation)
- Instance Servers (dungeons, private areas)

Backend Services:
- Auth Service (login, session management)
- Chat Service (global chat rooms)
- Social Service (guilds, friends)
- Market Service (trading, auction house)
- Analytics Service (metrics, logging)

Persistence:
- Player Database (accounts, inventory)
- World Database (persistent world state)
- Analytics Warehouse (historical data)
```

**Inter-Service Communication:**
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for async events
- RPC (gRPC, custom UDP) for synchronous calls
- Shared cache (Redis) for hot data

## BlueMarble Application

### Recommended Architecture

**Network Stack:**
```
Application: BlueMarble Protocol (custom message format)
├── Reliability: ENet library (proven, optimized)
├── Transport: UDP (low latency)
└── Physical: Standard IP networking
```

**Client-Server Model:**
- Server authoritative (prevent cheating)
- Client prediction for local player
- Snapshot interpolation for remote entities

**Scalability Approach:**
```
Phase 1: Single zone server (MVP)
- Support 500-1000 concurrent players
- Single contiguous play area
- Validate gameplay and networking

Phase 2: Multi-zone architecture
- 5-10 zone servers
- Support 5,000-10,000 players
- Seamless zone transitions

Phase 3: Dynamic zone allocation
- Auto-scale servers based on player density
- Load balancing and failover
- Support 10,000+ players
```

### Implementation Recommendations

#### 1. Protocol Design

**Message Format:**
```cpp
struct MessageHeader {
    uint16_t messageType;
    uint16_t messageLength;
    uint32_t sequence;
    uint32_t timestamp;
};

// Player movement (unreliable, high frequency)
struct PlayerMovementMessage {
    PlayerId id;
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 velocity;
    float rotation;
};

// Item transaction (reliable, low frequency)
struct ItemTransferMessage {
    PlayerId fromPlayer;
    PlayerId toPlayer;
    ItemId itemId;
    uint32_t quantity;
};
```

**Channel Strategy:**
```
Channel 0 (Unreliable): Position updates
Channel 1 (Reliable Ordered): Chat messages
Channel 2 (Reliable Unordered): Item transactions
Channel 3 (Reliable Ordered): World events
```

#### 2. Update Frequency Tiers

**Optimization Strategy:**
```cpp
// Different entities update at different rates
enum UpdateFrequency {
    CRITICAL_60HZ,    // Local player input
    HIGH_20HZ,        // Nearby players (0-100m)
    MEDIUM_5HZ,       // Distant players (100-500m)
    LOW_1HZ,          // Far entities (500m+)
    RARE_ON_CHANGE    // Static objects
};

// Adaptive updates based on activity
void UpdateEntity(Entity& entity) {
    if (entity.IsLocalPlayer()) {
        frequency = CRITICAL_60HZ;
    } else if (entity.IsMoving() && Distance < 100) {
        frequency = HIGH_20HZ;
    } else if (entity.IsMoving()) {
        frequency = MEDIUM_5HZ;
    } else {
        frequency = RARE_ON_CHANGE;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Bandwidth Budget

**Target Bandwidth:**
- Upload (player to server): 64 Kbps (8 KB/s)
- Download (server to player): 256 Kbps (32 KB/s)

**Allocation Example:**
```
Download Budget (32 KB/s):
- Nearby players (20 players * 200 bytes * 20 Hz) = 80,000 bytes/s ❌ Exceeds!

Optimized:
- Nearby players (20 players * 50 bytes * 10 Hz) = 10,000 bytes/s ✓
- Medium range (50 players * 30 bytes * 2 Hz) = 3,000 bytes/s ✓
- World events (variable, ~5 KB/s) = 5,000 bytes/s ✓
- Chat/social (variable, ~2 KB/s) = 2,000 bytes/s ✓
- Reserve (overhead, spikes) = 12,000 bytes/s ✓
Total: ~32 KB/s ✓
```

**Compression Techniques:**
- Quantize floats (positions to 1cm precision)
- Delta encoding (send difference from last state)
- Bit packing (flags into single bytes)
- Huffman coding for text (chat)

#### 4. Geological Event Propagation

**Unique Requirement:**
BlueMarble simulates geological events (earthquakes, erosion, resource regeneration).

**Network Strategy:**
```cpp
// Geological events are:
// - Low frequency (minutes to hours)
// - Large spatial impact (kilometers)
// - Non-critical timing (seconds of delay acceptable)

struct GeologicalEvent {
    EventType type; // EARTHQUAKE, EROSION, REGENERATION
    Vector3 epicenter;
    float radius;
    float magnitude;
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint32_t duration;
};

// Server broadcasts to affected zones
void PropagateGeologicalEvent(GeologicalEvent event) {
    // Find all zones intersecting event radius
    auto affectedZones = GetZonesInRadius(event.epicenter, event.radius);
    
    // Each zone broadcasts to connected players in range
    for (auto& zone : affectedZones) {
        zone.BroadcastEvent(event, RELIABLE_ORDERED);
    }
    
    // Low priority, doesn't interrupt gameplay updates
}

// Client applies gradually
void Client::ApplyGeologicalEvent(GeologicalEvent event) {
    // Start visual effects
    StartEarthquakeShake(event.magnitude);
    
    // Apply terrain deformation over time
    // Non-blocking, doesn't freeze gameplay
    for (float t = 0; t < event.duration; t += deltaTime) {
        ApplyTerrainDelta(event, t);
        Yield(); // Allow other systems to run
    }
}
```

### Testing and Validation

#### Simulated Latency

**Development Testing:**
```cpp
// Add artificial latency for testing
class NetworkSimulator {
    std::deque<DelayedPacket> sendQueue;
    std::deque<DelayedPacket> recvQueue;
    
    void SimulateSend(Packet packet) {
        int delay = RandomRange(30, 100); // ms
        float packetLoss = 0.02; // 2%
        
        if (Random() > packetLoss) {
            sendQueue.push_back({packet, CurrentTime() + delay});
        }
    }
    
    void Update() {
        while (!sendQueue.empty() && 
               sendQueue.front().sendTime <= CurrentTime()) {
            ActuallySend(sendQueue.front().packet);
            sendQueue.pop_front();
        }
    }
};
```

#### Metrics to Monitor

**Key Performance Indicators:**
```
Network:
- RTT (Round Trip Time): Target <100ms p95
- Packet Loss: Target <1%
- Bandwidth Usage: Target <256 Kbps down, <64 Kbps up
- Update Rate: Target 20 Hz for nearby entities

Game Feel:
- Input Lag: Target <50ms perceived
- Prediction Error Rate: Target <5% of movements
- Rubber-banding Frequency: Target <1 per minute
- Zone Transition Time: Target <2 seconds
```

**Logging and Analytics:**
```cpp
void LogNetworkStats() {
    stats.rtt = MeasureRTT();
    stats.packetLoss = CalculatePacketLoss();
    stats.bandwidth = MeasureBandwidth();
    
    // Send to analytics service
    Analytics::RecordNetworkStats(stats);
    
    // Alert if degraded
    if (stats.rtt > 150) {
        ShowLatencyWarning(player);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goals:**
- Single server-client connection
- Basic movement synchronization
- Client prediction prototype

**Deliverables:**
1. ENet integration and wrapper
2. Message serialization framework
3. Basic player movement (predicted)
4. Simple world state sync (1 zone)

**Success Criteria:**
- 2 players can see each other move smoothly
- Latency simulation works (30-100ms)
- No visible jitter with 50ms simulated latency

### Phase 2: Scalability (Weeks 5-8)

**Goals:**
- Interest management system
- Multi-zone server architecture
- Improved state synchronization

**Deliverables:**
1. Spatial grid interest management
2. Zone server prototype (2-3 zones)
3. Zone transition implementation
4. Bandwidth optimization

**Success Criteria:**
- 100 simulated players in single zone
- Zone transitions under 2 seconds
- Bandwidth under 256 Kbps per player

### Phase 3: Polish (Weeks 9-12)

**Goals:**
- Lag compensation
- Advanced prediction
- Performance optimization

**Deliverables:**
1. Lag compensation for interactions
2. Improved prediction algorithms
3. Comprehensive metrics dashboard
4. Load testing framework

**Success Criteria:**
- 500 players across multiple zones
- <100ms p95 latency under load
- <1% packet loss tolerance

### Technical Debt to Avoid

**Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Over-engineering Early:** Don't build distributed architecture before single server works
2. **Under-engineering Late:** Plan for scalability from day 1 (architecture decisions)
3. **Ignoring Testing:** Network code requires extensive testing under poor conditions
4. **Premature Optimization:** Profile before optimizing bandwidth/CPU
5. **Stateful Protocol Mistakes:** Carefully design state tracking for delta updates

**Best Practices:**
- Version all network messages (for protocol evolution)
- Log all network events (for debugging production issues)
- Test with real-world latency patterns (not just constant delay)
- Implement graceful degradation (game playable even with packet loss)
- Build monitoring from start (can't fix what you can't measure)
