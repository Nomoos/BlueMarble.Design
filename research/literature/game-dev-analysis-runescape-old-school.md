## Part I: Core Game Design Philosophy

### 1. Skill-Based Progression System

**The Classless Design:**

RuneScape pioneered the classless MMORPG model where character identity emerges from skill choices rather than predefined class archetypes. Players train 23 distinct skills:

**Combat Skills (7):**
- Attack (melee accuracy)
- Strength (melee damage)
- Defence (damage reduction)
- Ranged (ranged combat)
- Magic (spellcasting)
- Hitpoints (health)
- Prayer (temporary buffs)

**Gathering Skills (5):**
- Mining (ore extraction)
- Fishing (fish catching)
- Woodcutting (tree harvesting)
- Farming (crop growing)
- Hunter (creature trapping)

**Artisan/Production Skills (8):**
- Smithing (metal working)
- Cooking (food preparation)
- Crafting (jewelry, armor)
- Fletching (ranged weapons)
- Firemaking (light sources)
- Herblore (potion making)
- Construction (housing)
- Runecrafting (rune creation)

**Support Skills (3):**
- Agility (shortcuts, stamina)
- Thieving (stealing, lockpicking)
- Slayer (monster contracts)

**Progression Mechanics:**

```
Experience Formula:
- Level 1→2: 83 XP
- Level 2→3: 174 XP
- Level N: floor(1/4 * sum(floor(lvl + 300 * 2^(lvl/7))) for lvl in 1..N-1)
- Level 99: 13,034,431 XP total
- Level 120 (virtual): 104,273,167 XP

Experience Gain:
- Action-based (not kill-based like most MMOs)
- Scales with resource/enemy tier
- Bonus XP for high-efficiency methods
- No passive skill gain (active participation required)
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

Adopt skill-based progression for geological activities:
- **Geology Skills**: Rock identification, mineral extraction, core sampling
- **Environmental Skills**: Weather prediction, terrain analysis, ecosystem monitoring
- **Technical Skills**: Equipment maintenance, data analysis, sample processing
- **Survival Skills**: Navigation, resource management, emergency response

Allow players to specialize (become master geologist) or generalize (jack-of-all-trades surveyor).

**Design Implications:**
- Each activity type should have clear skill association
- Skills should level through doing relevant activities
- Higher skill levels unlock better tools, locations, and efficiency
- No arbitrary class restrictions on what players can attempt

---

### 2. Player-Driven Economy

**Grand Exchange Design:**

OSRS features one of gaming's most sophisticated player economies, centered around the Grand Exchange (GE):

**Economic Principles:**

1. **Minimal NPC Vendors:**
   - Most items player-crafted or gathered
   - NPC shops only stock basic supplies at high prices
   - Forces player interaction and trading

2. **Central Marketplace:**
   - Grand Exchange handles buy/sell orders
   - Price determined by supply/demand
   - Historical price tracking
   - Order fulfillment system (not instant trades)

3. **Item Sinks and Faucets:**
   - Faucets: Gathering skills, monster drops, quest rewards
   - Sinks: Item degradation, death penalties, high-level crafting

4. **Resource Transformation:**
   - Raw materials → Processed goods → Finished products
   - Value-add at each transformation step
   - Creates economic niches for specialists

**Economic Data:**

```
Item Flow Example - Rune Platebody:
1. Mining: Runite ore (40k GP, 15 min gather time)
2. Smithing: 5 runite bars (200k GP total, coal required)
3. Crafting: Rune platebody (220k GP, 2 min craft time)
4. Market: Sells for 240k GP
5. Profit: 20k GP margin for smith

Market Velocity:
- Daily GE volume: ~50-100B GP
- Active traders: ~500k players
- Price volatility: Low for common items, high for rare items
- Market manipulation: Possible but difficult at scale
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

Implement player-driven resource economy:

**Resource Flow:**
```
Geological Data Flow:
1. Survey & Sampling (field work)
   → Raw core samples, unprocessed data
   
2. Laboratory Analysis (processing)
   → Analyzed samples, calibrated data
   
3. Report Generation (knowledge work)
   → Research papers, geological maps
   
4. Equipment & Tools (crafting)
   → Survey equipment, analysis tools
   
5. Service Economy
   → Consulting, data sales, equipment rental
```

**Economic Design Requirements:**
- Central resource exchange (like GE)
- Raw resources abundant but require time/skill to gather
- Processing adds significant value
- High-end equipment requires rare materials
- Services create non-item economic activity
- Data/knowledge as tradeable commodity

---

### 3. Quest and Content Design

**Quest Philosophy:**

OSRS quests are story-driven adventures with unique mechanics, not repeatable "kill 10 rats" tasks:

**Quest Categories:**

1. **Novice Quests** (5-15 minutes)
   - Tutorial mechanics
   - Simple fetch/delivery
   - Low requirements
   - Example: "Cook's Assistant" - gather ingredients

2. **Intermediate Quests** (30-60 minutes)
   - Multi-stage objectives
   - Skill requirements (30-50 levels)
   - Light puzzles
   - Example: "Lost City" - access to new area

3. **Master Quests** (2-4 hours)
   - Complex storylines
   - High skill requirements (60-80 levels)
   - Challenging boss fights
   - Example: "Monkey Madness" - dungeon crawl

4. **Grandmaster Quests** (4-8 hours)
   - Epic narratives
   - Multiple skill requirements (70+ levels)
   - Raid-level challenges
   - Example: "Dragon Slayer II" - end-game content

**Quest Rewards:**

- Experience lamps (choose which skill)
- Unique equipment/items
- Access to new areas
- Unlock new training methods
- Lore and story progression

**Quest Point System:**

```
Total Quest Points: 293 (as of 2025)
Requirements for unlocks:
- 32 QP: Dragon Slayer
- 100 QP: Recipe for Disaster (subquests)
- 200 QP: Access to elite content
- 293 QP: Quest Cape (prestige item)
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

Design geological survey "missions" as OSRS-style quests:

**Mission Types:**

1. **Reconnaissance Surveys** (Novice)
   - Map unexplored regions
   - Identify basic rock formations
   - Simple sampling tasks
   - Rewards: Basic equipment, tutorial completion

2. **Research Expeditions** (Intermediate)
   - Multi-day field campaigns
   - Collect specific sample types
   - Environmental challenges
   - Rewards: Advanced tools, access to new regions

3. **Major Surveys** (Expert)
   - Comprehensive geological mapping
   - High-risk environments
   - Team coordination required
   - Rewards: Rare equipment, significant data sets

4. **Landmark Discoveries** (Master)
   - Search for specific phenomena
   - Complex analysis requirements
   - Potential for named discoveries
   - Rewards: Prestige, exclusive access, unique findings

**Mission Point System:**
- Accumulate points for mission completion
- Unlock progression gates (access to Antarctica, deep ocean surveys)
- Track player achievement
- Provide non-skill-based progression metric

---

### 4. Risk vs. Reward: The Wilderness

**Wilderness Design:**

The Wilderness is OSRS's PvP zone, demonstrating risk-based content design:

**Mechanics:**

- Players can attack each other
- Items lost on death (except 3-4 protected items)
- Higher-level areas = higher rewards + higher risk
- Safe zones at edges for entry/exit
- Level-based combat restrictions (level 100 can't attack level 3)

**Risk Tiers:**

```
Tier 1: Low Wilderness (Levels 1-10)
- Low-value resources
- Escape routes nearby
- Popular training areas
- Risk: ~10-50k GP

Tier 2: Mid Wilderness (Levels 11-30)
- Moderate resources
- Some profitable activities
- Higher player density
- Risk: ~100-500k GP

Tier 3: Deep Wilderness (Levels 31-50+)
- High-value resources
- Rare monsters/bosses
- Dangerous but profitable
- Risk: 1-10M+ GP
```

**Economic Impact:**

The Wilderness serves as primary item sink:
- ~20-30% of high-value items leave economy daily
- Creates demand for replacement equipment
- Balances item inflation
- Adds excitement/stakes to gameplay

**BlueMarble Application:**

Design risk-based environmental zones without PvP:

**Environmental Hazard Zones:**

```
Tier 1: Moderate Risk Regions
- Unstable weather patterns
- Basic equipment sufficient
- Equipment durability loss on failure
- Examples: Volcanic regions, storm-prone coasts

Tier 2: High Risk Regions
- Extreme environments
- Specialized equipment required
- Significant equipment loss on failure
- Examples: Deep ocean, active fault zones

Tier 3: Extreme Risk Regions
- Life-threatening conditions
- Custom equipment mandatory
- Total loss possible
- Examples: Deep Earth drilling, active volcano interiors
```

**Risk Mechanics:**
- Environmental challenges replace PvP
- Equipment degradation and loss
- Data loss if not properly backed up
- Rescue operations for failed expeditions
- Insurance and contingency systems

**Reward Scaling:**
- Rare geological formations in risky areas
- Valuable resource deposits
- Unique research opportunities
- Prestige for successful expeditions

- All actions align to tick boundaries
- Player actions queued and processed on tick
- Predictable timing for mechanics

World Structure:
- Multiple world servers (100+)
- Each world: ~2,000 player capacity
- Instanced content for some activities
- Shared database for character data

Region System:
- World divided into 8x8 tile regions
- Regions loaded dynamically as players move
- NPC spawns tied to regions
- Reduces memory footprint
```

**Network Protocol:**

```
Communication Model:

```

**BlueMarble Application:**

Adopt tick-based architecture for geological simulation:

**Simulation Tick System:**

```
Geological Time Scales:
- Real-time tick: 1 second (player actions)
- Simulation tick: 1 minute (environmental updates)
- Geological tick: 1 hour (long-term processes)

Player Actions (1s tick):
- Movement and interaction
- Tool usage
- Data collection
- Communication

Environmental Sim (60s tick):
- Weather system updates
- Resource regeneration

- Animal migrations

Geological Sim (3600s tick):
- Tectonic movement
- Long-term climate
- Resource deposit changes
- Landscape evolution
```

**Region-Based Loading:**

```
Chunked World:
- Planet divided into 1km² regions
- Load regions within player view distance
- Stream terrain/geological data
- Persistent region state on server

Data Streaming Priority:
1. Terrain mesh and collision
2. Geological formation data
3. Resource node locations

**BlueMarble Database Schema:**

```sql
-- Adapted for geological simulation

CREATE TABLE researchers (

    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100),

    total_field_time_hours INT,
    prestige_points INT,
    organization_id BIGINT
);

CREATE TABLE geological_skills (
    researcher_id BIGINT,
    skill_id INT,
    experience BIGINT,
    level INT,
    last_trained TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (researcher_id, skill_id)
);

CREATE TABLE field_equipment (

    condition DECIMAL(4,2), -- 0.00 to 100.00
    last_maintenance TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (researcher_id, slot_type, slot_index)
);

CREATE TABLE sample_collection (

```

**Performance Considerations:**

```
Indexing Strategy:
- Primary keys on all tables (clustered indexes)
- Index on researcher_id for all related tables
- Spatial indexes for location data
- Composite indexes for common queries

Partitioning:
- Partition character_skills by researcher_id range
- Partition sample_collection by collection_timestamp (monthly)
- Partition survey_missions by status and timestamp

Caching Strategy:
- Redis cache for active player data
- 15-minute TTL for character info
- Invalidate on write operations
- Pre-cache organization member lists

Backup Schedule:
- Full backup: Daily at low-traffic hours
- Incremental backup: Every 6 hours
- Transaction log backup: Every 15 minutes
- Point-in-time recovery capability
```

## Conclusion

RuneScape (Old School) demonstrates that skill-based, player-driven MMORPGs can achieve long-term success through:

**Core Principles:**
1. Respect player autonomy and choice
2. Create interconnected, meaningful systems
3. Foster player-driven economy and social structures
4. Maintain technical reliability and integrity
5. Evolve carefully with community involvement
6. Design for long-term engagement, not quick profits

**Key Takeaways for BlueMarble:**

✅ **Adopt**: Skill-based progression, player economy, quest-style missions, achievement systems  
✅ **Adapt**: Tick-based architecture, region loading, social features, monetization model  
⚠️ **Avoid**: Fundamental system overhauls, pay-to-win, ignoring community feedback  
🔍 **Research Further**: Bot prevention strategies, server scalability patterns, content update cadence

**Next Steps:**

1. Prototype skill system with 3-4 core geological skills
2. Implement basic resource gathering and processing loop
3. Design player economy foundation (exchange system)
4. Create 5-10 tutorial missions
5. Test with small player group (alpha testing)
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Scale to broader beta test
