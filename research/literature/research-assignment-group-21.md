- ✅ Document source URLs and citations

## Work Guidelines

1. **Locate Source:** Find the resource in `online-game-dev-resources.md`
2. **Deep Analysis:** Don't just summarize - analyze applicability to BlueMarble
3. **Document Structure:** Follow template in `research/literature/example-topic.md`
4. **Cross-linking:** Reference related topics and previous research
5. **Discovery Logging:** Track any new sources found during analysis

## New Sources Discovery

During your research, if you discover additional valuable sources, log them here:

### Discovery Template

```markdown
**Source Name:** [Name of discovered source]  
**Discovered From:** [Which topic led to this discovery]  
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]  
**Category:** [GameDev-Tech/GameDev-Design/GameDev-Content/Survival/Other]  
**Rationale:** [Why this source is valuable for BlueMarble]  
**Estimated Effort:** [Hours needed to analyze]
```

### Example

**Source Name:** Advanced MMORPG Networking Patterns (hypothetical)  
**Discovered From:** Multiplayer Game Programming book  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Contains specific patterns for planet-scale MMORPGs that directly apply to BlueMarble's architecture  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours

### Discoveries Log

**Source Name:** Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - References section  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Provides design patterns specifically for game development including component pattern (essential for ECS), service locator, and other patterns directly applicable to BlueMarble's architecture. Complements Gregory's architectural overview with practical implementation patterns.  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Source Name:** EnTT and Flecs (ECS Implementations)  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - ECS recommendations  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Modern, production-ready Entity Component System libraries that could be evaluated for BlueMarble. EnTT is header-only C++ library with excellent performance; Flecs adds advanced features like hierarchies and queries. Critical for data-oriented design decisions.  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (combined analysis)

**Source Name:** Unreal Engine Source Code (GitHub)  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - References  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Real-world implementation of patterns discussed in Gregory's book. Valuable for understanding how AAA engines solve scalability and architecture challenges. Can inform BlueMarble's custom engine decisions.  
**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours (focused subsystem analysis)

**Source Name:** Second Life Infrastructure Talks  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - MMORPG examples  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Lessons from scaling virtual world to millions of users. Second Life's user-generated content and massive persistent world are directly relevant to BlueMarble's planet-scale ambitions.  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Source Name:** EVE Online Technical Blog  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - MMORPG examples  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** CCP Games regularly publishes technical articles about EVE's architecture, including large-scale combat (Time Dilation), economy systems, and server infrastructure. Planet-scale MMORPG with similar challenges to BlueMarble.  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 hours

**Source Name:** Interest Management in MMORPGs (Academic Papers)  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - Networking section  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** Academic research on optimizing which entities to sync to which clients in MMORPGs. Critical for BlueMarble's scalability to thousands of concurrent players per server shard.  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

**Source Name:** TimescaleDB Documentation  
**Discovered From:** Game Engine Architecture (3rd Edition) - Time-series data discussion  
**Priority:** Low  
**Category:** GameDev-Tech  
**Rationale:** PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. Could be valuable for BlueMarble's geological simulation history and analytics. Lower priority as basic PostgreSQL sufficient for initial implementation.  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
