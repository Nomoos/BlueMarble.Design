## Recommendations for Next Batch

Based on priority and technical coverage gaps, recommended next 4 sources:

### Batch 2 Recommendation

1. **Gaffer on Games** (Critical) - Fill networking fundamentals gap
2. **RPG Creator Kit** (High) - Working code examples needed
3. **Unity Performance Best Practices** (High) - Performance gap
4. **Gabriel Gambetta** (High) - Visualization aids for prediction concepts

**Rationale:**
- Addresses one critical priority source
- Fills working implementation gap (RPG Creator Kit)
- Covers performance optimization gap
- Adds teaching/visualization resources
- Estimated total: 24-36 hours

**Alternative if prioritizing design:**
Replace Gabriel Gambetta with GDC Vault for industry case studies.
