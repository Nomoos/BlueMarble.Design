### 4. Documentation Best Practices

#### Writing Effective Patterns

**Pattern Naming Conventions:**

- **Descriptive**: Name clearly indicates pattern purpose
- **Memorable**: Easy to recall and reference
- **Distinctive**: Unique within pattern library
- **Consistent**: Follows naming style of other patterns

**Good Names:**
- "Progressive Difficulty"
- "Resource Conversion Chain"
- "Complementary Abilities"

**Poor Names:**
- "The System" (too vague)
- "Advanced Resource Management Optimization Strategy" (too verbose)
- "Thing-a-majig" (unprofessional)

**Context Description:**

Clearly state when pattern applies:
- Game genre or type
- Development stage
- Player experience level
- System requirements

**Example:**
```
Context: Resource management games where players gather, 
process, and consume materials over extended play sessions, 
requiring strategic planning and economic decision-making.
```

**Problem Statement:**

Articulate the design challenge precisely:
- What needs to be solved?
- Why is it a problem?
- What are the symptoms?
- What happens if unsolved?

**Forces Documentation:**

Identify competing concerns:
- Technical limitations
- Player psychology factors
- Design goal conflicts
- Business constraints

**BlueMarble Pattern Example:**

```markdown
## Pattern: Time-Scale Layering

**Context:** Simulation games with multiple temporal processes 
(player actions, environmental cycles, long-term changes)

**Problem:** Single time scale can't serve both immediate player 
actions and long-term simulation realism

**Forces:**
- Player actions require responsive feedback (real-time)
- Environmental cycles need visible progression (accelerated)
- Geological processes must show effects (extremely accelerated)
- Performance limits calculation frequency
- Players need comprehensible time relationships

**Solution:** Implement multiple concurrent time scales with 
clear relationships, each appropriate for its process type

**Consequences:**
+ Realistic long-term simulation within playable timeframe
+ Clear cause-effect relationships at each scale
+ Enables both immediate and strategic gameplay
- Complexity in time management systems
- Potential confusion about time passage
- Interaction between scales requires careful design

**Implementation:**
1. Define distinct time scales (real, game, simulation)
2. Establish clear ratio relationships (1:10, 1:1000)
3. Create visual indicators for each scale
4. Design interactions between scales
5. Test comprehension with diverse players

**Examples:**
- Civilization series: Strategic turns represent years
- The Sims: Sim-days pass in real-time minutes
- SimCity: Years pass as players build

**BlueMarble Scales:**
- Real-time: Player actions (1:1)
- Game-time: Day/night cycles (10:1)
- Geo-time: Geological processes (1000:1)

**Related Patterns:**
- Asynchronous Actions
- Visible Progress Indicators
- Simulation Fidelity Control
```

and player comprehension limits

**Forces:**
- Scientific accuracy maintains educational value
- Real-time performance requires optimization
- Players need comprehensible systems
- Experts expect geological plausibility
- Simplification risks loss of emergent behavior

**Solution:** Abstract geological processes to essential behaviors that 
produce plausible results without full physics simulation

**Consequences:**
+ Achieves playable performance
+ Maintains scientific plausibility
+ Enables player understanding
+ Preserves emergent complexity
- May disappoint hardcore geologists
- Simplifications visible to experts
- Requires careful abstraction design

**Implementation:**

3. Validate against real geological data
4. Test for emergent behavior preservation
5. Iterate based on expert and player feedback

**BlueMarble Examples:**
- Erosion: Simplified water flow + sediment transport
- Tectonic shift: Zone-based displacement vs. continuous
- Mineral formation: Probability fields vs. chemical reactions
- Weathering: Time-based degradation vs. molecular breakdown
```

#### Pattern 2: Depth-Risk-Reward Gradient

```markdown
**Context:** Exploration games with vertical progression

**Problem:** Need to motivate deeper exploration while maintaining 
accessible surface gameplay

**Forces:**
- Beginners need safe learning environment
- Experts seek challenging rewards
