1. Read/review the complete source material
2. Extract key concepts relevant to BlueMarble MMORPG
3. Document technical approaches and patterns
4. Identify implementation recommendations
5. Note any additional sources discovered

**Deliverable:**
- Create comprehensive analysis document in `research/literature/`
- Filename: `game-dev-analysis-game-programming-patterns-online-edition.md`
- Minimum length: 300-500 lines
- Include: Executive Summary, Core Concepts, BlueMarble Application, Implementation Recommendations, References

### 2. Brackeys (Historical Archive) (High)

**Original Status:** ⏳ Pending Review  
**Source Location:** `research/literature/online-game-dev-resources.md`  

**Research Tasks:**
1. Read/review the complete source material
2. Extract key concepts relevant to BlueMarble MMORPG
3. Document technical approaches and patterns
4. Identify implementation recommendations
5. Note any additional sources discovered

**Deliverable:**
- Create comprehensive analysis document in `research/literature/`
- Filename: `game-dev-analysis-brackeys-historical-archive.md`
- Minimum length: 300-500 lines
- Include: Executive Summary, Core Concepts, BlueMarble Application, Implementation Recommendations, References

## Quality Standards

- ✅ Proper YAML front matter at document start
- ✅ Meet minimum length requirements
- ✅ Include code examples where relevant
