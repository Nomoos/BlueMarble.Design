## Overview

"The Dreams in the Witch House" (1933) combines mathematics, witchcraft, and cosmic horror into a nightmarish tale of dimensional travel. Mathematics student Walter Gilman rents a room in a witch's former house, where non-Euclidean architecture allows dreams to become terrifyingly real.

## Story Summary

### The Witch House

Walter Gilman, a mathematics student at Miskatonic University, rents a cheap attic room in the "Witch House"—a decrepit building that once belonged to Keziah Mason, a witch executed during the Salem trials of 1692. The room has strange angles that seem geometrically impossible.

**Keziah Mason's History**:
- Arrested in Salem witch trials (1692)
- Vanished from locked, guarded cell
- Claimed to have discovered mathematical formulae for crossing dimensional boundaries
- Said mathematics and certain angles could breach barriers between worlds
- Accompanied by a familiar: Brown Jenkin (rat-like thing with human face)

### The Dreams Begin

Gilman begins experiencing vivid, disturbing dreams:
- Travels through bizarre geometric spaces
- Visits alien worlds and distant eras
- Encounters Keziah Mason (still alive, impossibly old)
- Meets Brown Jenkin (more horrifying than any rat)
- Sometimes finds himself physically displaced
- Wakes in strange locations with no memory of getting there

**Physical Evidence**:
- Mud on feet after dream-travels
- Strange scratches and marks
- Objects moved in his absence
- Witnesses see him sleepwalking (or dream-walking)
- The walls seem to shift

### Brown Jenkin

The familiar appears in waking world:
- Rat-sized but wrong
- Human-like hands and face
- Bearded, with sharp teeth
- Speaks in human voice (chittering)
- Serves Keziah Mason
- Actually an alien entity in animal form

### The Sabbath and Nyarlathotep

Gilman's dreams take darker turn:
- Drawn to nighttime gatherings
- Other witches and entities present
- Nyarlathotep appears (Black Man of witch lore)
- Keziah demands Gilman sign the Black Book
- Resists but compulsion grows stronger
- Realizes they plan to use him in ritual

### The Ritual Night (Walpurgis)

On Walpurgis Night (April 30-May 1):
- Keziah and Brown Jenkin abduct a child
- Plan to sacrifice child to Azathoth
- Need Gilman's assistance (dimensional mathematics)
- Transport him involuntarily to ceremony
- He's to wield the sacrificial knife

### The Desperate Act

At the last moment, Gilman resists:
- Refuses to harm the child
- Struggles with Keziah and Brown Jenkin
- Strangles Brown Jenkin with bare hands
- Keziah flees through dimensional gate
- But child already fatally injured
- Gilman barely escapes back to his room

### The Aftermath

Landlady finds disaster:
- Gilman alive but traumatized
- Child's body discovered elsewhere (killed in ritual)
- Gilman blamed by some, believed mad by others
- He knows the terrible truth
- Keziah still out there, vengeful

### Gilman's Death

Days later:
- Strange sounds in walls
- Chest torn open while sleeping
- Heart removed with surgical precision
- Tiny human-like teeth marks
- Brown Jenkin's corpse found sealed in wall
- New familiar had killed Gilman as revenge

Later: Building demolished, revealing horrors sealed within walls for centuries.

## Significance and Impact

### Mathematics as Gateway

**Non-Euclidean Geometry**:
- Certain angles allow dimensional breach
- Mathematical formulae open doors
- Architecture matters (some rooms are gates)
- Knowledge enables but also dooms
- Academic study leads to cosmic contact

**Game Design Application**:
- Geometry puzzles opening portals
- Mathematics skill unlocking dangerous areas
- Room design with "wrong" angles
- Knowledge as key and curse
- Scholar character vulnerability

### Dreams as Real

**Dream Travel**:
- Not mere dreams but actual journeys
- Physical consequences in waking world
- Body moves during "dreams"
- Can be trapped in dream state
- Other entities use dreams as pathway

**Blurred Boundaries**:
- Cannot distinguish dream from reality
- Physical evidence of dream events
- Dream-world and waking-world overlap
- Sleepwalking with purpose
- Involuntary transportation

**Game Design Application**:
- Dream dimension exploration
- Sleep mechanics with danger
- Wake in different locations
- Physical items from dreams
- Cannot safely rest
- Reality distortion effects

### Witchcraft Meets Cosmic Horror

**Traditional + Alien**:
- Historical witch (Keziah) uses alien mathematics
- Familiar (Brown Jenkin) is cosmic entity
- Sabbath = dimensional gathering
- Black Man = Nyarlathotep
- Spells = mathematical formulae
- Devil worship = Outer God cult

**Game Design Application**:
- Witch covens with cosmic connections
- Traditional magic recontextualized
- Historical occultism + aliens
- Familiar creatures as alien servants
- Ritual sites as dimensional weak points

### Child Sacrifice Horror

**Ultimate Taboo**:
- Innocent child targeted
- Player character forced to participate
- Can resist but at terrible cost
- Child dies despite efforts
- Guilt and trauma remain

**Game Design Application**:
- Moral choice scenarios (resist compulsion)
- Children in danger (motivating force)
- Failed protection quests (tragedy)
- Consequences of player choice
- Mature themes (handle carefully)

## Key Themes

### Architecture as Horror

**The Angled Room**:
- Walls meet at impossible angles
- Geometry physically wrong
- Causes dizziness and unease
- Functions as dimensional gateway
- Cannot be accurately measured

**Game Design Application**:
- Non-Euclidean level design
- Disorienting architecture
- Camera effects near certain angles
- Navigation confusion
- Rooms larger inside than outside

### Compulsion and Loss of Will

**Involuntary Action**:
- Gilman controlled during dreams
- Physically moved against will
- Forced toward evil acts
- Resistance possible but difficult
- Never fully in control

**Game Design Application**:
- Player agency temporarily removed
- Cutscenes showing character controlled
- Quick-time events to resist
- Sanity/will saves
- Possession mechanics

### Academic Obsession

**Dangerous Study**:
- Gilman's mathematics research enables contact
- Intellectual curiosity = vulnerability
- Knowledge cannot be unlearned
- Understanding brings doom
- Should have stayed ignorant

**Game Design Application**:
- Research skills with dark consequences
- Academic questlines with traps
- Intelligence as liability
- Forbidden knowledge mechanics
- Scholar NPC warnings

### Historical Horror

**Centuries-Old Evil**:
- Keziah lived 240+ years
- Brown Jenkin even older
- Witch trials revealed real witches
- Past evil persists into present
- History literally haunts

**Game Design Application**:
- Historical NPCs still active
- Flashback sequences (witch trials)
- Archaeological dangers (still active)
- Curses lasting centuries
- Temporal discontinuity

## Stylistic Techniques

### Dreamlike Narration

**Blurred Reality**:
- Never certain what's dream vs real
- Unreliable perception
- Fragmentary memories
- Contradictory evidence
- Reader as confused as protagonist

**Game Design Application**:
- Seamless transitions (no "you wake up" text)
- Player unsure if in dream
- Different rules in dream state
- Memory gaps after dreams
- Questioning reality

### Body Horror

**Physical Violation**:
- Scratches from Brown Jenkin
- Body moved against will
- Final scene: chest torn open, heart removed
- Small teeth marks
- Surgical precision

**Game Design Application**:
- Damage from invisible/small enemies
- Body modification horror
- Death sequences (horrific)
- Medical horror aesthetic
- Small creature danger

### Mathematical Description

**Technical Language**:
- Geometric terminology
- Mathematical concepts
- Spatial relationships
- Dimensional theory
- Scientific tone describing impossible

**Effect**: Academic authority makes impossible seem plausible
