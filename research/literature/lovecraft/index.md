## Overview

This index organizes research on H.P. Lovecraft's works and the Cthulhu Mythos into focused, digestible documents. Each document covers a specific aspect of Lovecraft's work, providing structured knowledge for incorporating Lovecraftian elements into storytelling, horror writing, and worldbuilding in the BlueMarble project.

## About H.P. Lovecraft

H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) created a unique brand of horror that has profoundly influenced modern horror, science fiction, and fantasy. His "cosmic horror" emphasizes humanity's insignificance in an indifferent universe populated by ancient, incomprehensible entities. The Cthulhu Mythos—a shared universe of interconnected stories—has become a foundational element of horror literature and continues to inspire writers, game designers, and creators worldwide.
