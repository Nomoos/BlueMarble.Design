## Executive Summary

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. Pioneered by Netflix with their Chaos Monkey tool, this practice has been adapted for game server infrastructure to improve reliability and player experience. For BlueMarble's MMORPG, chaos engineering provides a systematic approach to discovering failures before players do.

**Key Takeaways for BlueMarble:**
- Proactively discover failure modes before they impact players
- Build confidence in system resilience through controlled experiments
- Reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) by practicing failure scenarios
- Improve monitoring and alerting based on chaos experiment findings
- Create a culture of learning from failure rather than avoiding it

**Practice Value:**
- **Prevents Outages:** Find weaknesses before production incidents
- **Improves Recovery:** Teams practice responding to failures
- **Better Monitoring:** Reveals gaps in observability
- **Player Experience:** Fewer unexpected downtimes
- **Cost Savings:** Prevent revenue loss from outages

## Part I: Chaos Engineering Fundamentals

### 1. Principles of Chaos Engineering

**The Four Principles (from Principles of Chaos Engineering):**

```
1. Build a Hypothesis around Steady State Behavior
   - Define what "normal" looks like for your system
   - Example: "99% of player requests complete in <100ms"
   
2. Vary Real-World Events
   - Inject failures that could actually happen
   - Server crashes, network issues, database slowdowns
   
3. Run Experiments in Production
   - Staging can't replicate production complexity
   - Start small, gradually increase scope
   
4. Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
   - Manual chaos is inconsistent
   - Automated experiments catch regressions
```

**Why Chaos Engineering for Games:**

```
Traditional Testing Limitations:
❌ Unit tests: Don't catch distributed system issues
❌ Integration tests: Don't simulate real load
❌ Staging: Doesn't match production scale/complexity
❌ Manual testing: Slow, inconsistent, expensive

Chaos Engineering Benefits:
✅ Tests real system under real conditions
✅ Finds emergent failures (only appear at scale)
✅ Validates recovery procedures
✅ Builds team muscle memory for incidents
✅ Improves monitoring and alerting
```

### 2. Chaos Experiments for Game Servers

**Experiment 1: Random Server Termination**

```
Hypothesis: When a game server crashes, players automatically reconnect to another server within 30 seconds

Experiment Design:
1. Monitor baseline player experience (latency, disconnects)
2. Randomly terminate 1 game server every hour
3. Measure:
   - Time for players to reconnect
   - Number of players disconnected
   - Data loss (if any)
   - Player complaints in chat
4. Compare against baseline

Expected Outcome:
- Players reconnect within 10 seconds
- No data loss (last save < 5 seconds ago)
- Load balancer redirects to healthy servers
- No spike in support tickets

Implementation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Chaos experiment: Random server termination

NAMESPACE="bluemarble-production"
GAME_SERVER_LABEL="app=game-server"

while true; do
  # Wait random interval (30-90 minutes)
  WAIT_TIME=$((RANDOM % 3600 + 1800))
  echo "Waiting ${WAIT_TIME}s before next experiment..."
  sleep $WAIT_TIME
  
  # Select random game server pod
  POD=$(kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l $GAME_SERVER_LABEL \
    -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | shuf -n 1)
  
  echo "Terminating pod: $POD"
  kubectl delete pod -n $NAMESPACE $POD
  
  # Log experiment for later analysis
  echo "$(date),pod_deletion,$POD" >> chaos_experiments.log
done
```

Results to Track:
- Player reconnection rate
- Session recovery success rate
- Support ticket volume
- Revenue impact (if players quit)
```

**Experiment 2: Network Latency Injection**

```
Hypothesis: System remains playable with 200ms additional latency

Experiment Design:
1. Establish baseline (normal latency distribution)
2. Inject 200ms latency on 10% of game servers
3. Measure:
   - Player complaints
   - Gameplay metrics (actions per minute)
   - Combat effectiveness
   - Disconnection rate
4. Gradually increase affected servers if stable

Implementation (using tc - Traffic Control):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Add 200ms latency to network interface

INTERFACE="eth0"
LATENCY="200ms"

# Add latency
sudo tc qdisc add dev $INTERFACE root netem delay $LATENCY

# Run for 15 minutes
sleep 900

# Remove latency
sudo tc qdisc del dev $INTERFACE root

echo "Latency experiment complete"
```

Why This Matters:
- Players on different continents experience latency
- ISP issues cause intermittent slowdowns
- Server-to-server communication delays
- Validate lag compensation works correctly
```

**Experiment 3: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**

```
Hypothesis: System degrades gracefully when database connections exhausted

Experiment Design:
1. Normal state: 100 DB connections, 70% utilized
2. Reduce connection pool to 20 connections
3. Measure:
   - Request latency (should increase)
   - Error rate (should remain low)
   - Queue depth (should increase but not overflow)
   - Player impact (minimal for non-DB operations)

Implementation:
```sql
-- Temporarily reduce connection limit
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Monitor for 10 minutes
-- Watch metrics in Grafana

-- Restore normal limit
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 100;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

Expected Behavior:
✅ Requests queue rather than fail immediately
✅ Circuit breaker opens after threshold
✅ Cache hit rate increases (fallback to cache)
✅ Non-DB operations unaffected
❌ New connections fail hard (bad!)
❌ Cascading failures to other services (bad!)

Improvements Discovered:
- Need connection pool monitoring/alerting
- Implement request timeouts
- Add circuit breakers
- Increase cache usage
```

**Experiment 4: High CPU Load**

```
Hypothesis: Server maintains 30+ FPS tick rate under 90% CPU load

Experiment Design:
1. Baseline: 50% CPU, 60 FPS tick rate
2. Generate CPU load (stress tool)
3. Measure:
   - Server tick rate
   - Player perception of lag
   - Geological simulation accuracy
   - Combat responsiveness

Implementation:
```bash
# Generate CPU stress
stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 300s --metrics-brief

# Monitor server performance
while true; do
  TICK_RATE=$(grep "tick_rate" /var/log/game_server.log | tail -1)
  echo "$(date): $TICK_RATE"
  sleep 1
done
```

Thresholds:
- Green: Tick rate > 55 FPS (acceptable)
- Yellow: Tick rate 45-55 FPS (degraded)
- Red: Tick rate < 45 FPS (unacceptable)

Auto-Scaling Trigger:
- If tick rate < 50 FPS for 5 minutes
- Spawn additional game server instance
- Migrate 25% of players to new server
```

### 3. Game-Specific Failure Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Geological Simulation Service Down**

```
Impact: Real-time geological events stop, but gameplay continues

Experiment:
1. Stop geological simulation service
2. Monitor player experience
3. Check if cached data sufficient
4. Measure time until players notice

Expected:
- Players don't immediately notice (30-60 seconds)
- Cached geological state used
- Non-geological gameplay unaffected
- Alerts trigger within 1 minute

Contingency:
- Geological service has read replicas
- Fall back to static geological state
- Queue geological updates for replay
- Manual intervention after 15 minutes

Code:
```python
class GeologicalService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fallback_mode = False
        self.cache = GeologicalCache()
    
    def get_geological_state(self, zone_id):
        try:
            return self.primary_service.query(zone_id)
        except ServiceUnavailable:
            if not self.fallback_mode:
                log.warning("Geological service unavailable, entering fallback mode")
                self.fallback_mode = True
                alert.trigger("geological_service_down")
            
            # Use cached data
            cached = self.cache.get(zone_id)
            if cached and cached.age < 300:  # 5 minutes
                return cached.data
            
            # Return static state as last resort
            return self.get_static_state(zone_id)
```
```

**Scenario 2: Authentication Service Overload**

```
Impact: New players cannot log in, existing sessions unaffected

Experiment:
1. Simulate login storm (1000 requests/sec)
2. Monitor:
   - Login success rate
   - Queue depth
   - Existing player sessions
   - Error messages shown to players

Rate Limiting Implementation:
```python
from redis import Redis
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class LoginRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = Redis()
        self.limit = 100  # Max logins per minute
    
    def allow_login(self, ip_address):
        key = f"login_rate:{ip_address}"
        current = self.redis.get(key)
        
        if current is None:
            # First login this minute
            self.redis.setex(key, 60, 1)
            return True
        
        count = int(current)
        if count >= self.limit:
            return False
        
        self.redis.incr(key)
        return True

# Usage
limiter = LoginRateLimiter()

@app.post("/login")
def login(request):
    if not limiter.allow_login(request.ip):
        return {"error": "Too many login attempts, try again in 1 minute"}
    
    # Process login...
```

Queue System for Login Storms:
```python
import asyncio
from collections import deque

class LoginQueue:
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent=50):
        self.queue = deque()
        self.processing = 0
        self.max_concurrent = max_concurrent
    
    async def add_to_queue(self, user_id):
        position = len(self.queue)
        self.queue.append(user_id)
        
        return {
            "status": "queued",
            "position": position,
            "estimated_wait": position * 2  # 2 seconds per login
        }
    
    async def process_queue(self):
        while self.queue:
            if self.processing < self.max_concurrent:
                user_id = self.queue.popleft()
                self.processing += 1
                asyncio.create_task(self.process_login(user_id))
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

Player Experience:
- Show queue position and estimated wait time
- Better than "Service Unavailable" error
- Prevents thundering herd problem
```

**Scenario 3: Data Center Failure**

```
Impact: Entire region down, failover to secondary region

Experiment (Disaster Recovery Drill):
1. Schedule maintenance window (low traffic time)
2. Announce planned "test" to players
3. Simulate primary data center failure
4. Measure:
   - Time to detect failure (should be < 30s)
   - Time to failover (should be < 5 minutes)
   - Data loss (should be 0)
   - Player experience during failover

Disaster Recovery Procedure:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# DR Failover Script

echo "Starting disaster recovery failover..."

# 1. Update DNS to point to secondary region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456 \
  --change-batch file://failover-dns.json

# 2. Promote database replica to primary
pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data

# 3. Start game servers in secondary region
kubectl scale deployment game-server --replicas=50 -n bluemarble-secondary

# 4. Verify health checks
for i in {1..10}; do
  HEALTH=$(curl -s https://api-secondary.bluemarble.com/health)
  if [ "$HEALTH" == "OK" ]; then
    echo "Secondary region healthy"
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done

# 5. Monitor player migration
watch "kubectl get pods -n bluemarble-secondary | grep game-server | wc -l"

echo "Failover complete. Monitor player metrics."
```

Success Criteria:
✅ DNS propagation < 1 minute
✅ Players auto-reconnect to secondary region
✅ No data loss (WAL replay successful)
✅ Full capacity within 10 minutes
✅ < 1% player churn from incident
```

        self.baseline = self.get_baseline_metrics()
        self.thresholds = {
            'error_rate': 0.05,      # 5% error rate
            'latency_p95': 200,      # 200ms
            'player_count': 0.90,    # 90% of baseline
            'disconnection_rate': 0.02  # 2% disconnect rate
        }
    
    def check_metrics(self, current_metrics):
        alerts = []
        
        # Check error rate
        if current_metrics['error_rate'] > self.thresholds['error_rate']:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'critical',

            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'warning',
                'metric': 'latency_p95',
                'value': current_metrics['latency_p95'],
                'threshold': self.thresholds['latency_p95']
            })
        
        # Check player count
        ratio = current_metrics['player_count'] / self.baseline['player_count']
        if ratio < self.thresholds['player_count']:

## Part IV: BlueMarble-Specific Chaos Scenarios

### 1. Geological Simulation Chaos

**Experiment: Simulate Computation Spike**

```python
# Inject high-complexity geological event
def chaos_complex_geological_event():
    """Simulate earthquake requiring intensive calculation"""
    
    event = GeologicalEvent(
        type="earthquake",
        magnitude=8.5,  # Very large
        location=(45.0, -120.0),
        affected_radius=1000,  # 1000km radius
        fracture_complexity="high",
        aftershock_count=50
    )
    
    # This will stress CPU and database
    geological_service.process_event(event)
    
    # Monitor:
    # - Geological service CPU
    # - Tick rate impact
    # - Player experience in affected area
    # - Database query latency

Expected Behavior:
✅ Geological service scales up automatically
✅ Event processing queued if overloaded
✅ Non-affected areas unimpacted
✅ Players notified of ongoing event

Failure Modes to Discover:
❌ Geological service OOM (out of memory)
❌ Database query timeout
❌ Tick rate drops globally (not isolated)
❌ Players in affected area disconnected
```

### 2. Economy System Chaos

**Experiment: Market Order Flood**

```python
def chaos_market_flood():
    """Simulate massive trading volume"""
    
    # Create 10,000 market orders rapidly
    for i in range(10000):
        create_market_order(
            player_id=random_player(),
            resource_type=random_resource(),
            quantity=random.randint(1, 100),
            price=random_price()
        )
    
    # Monitor:
    # - Order matching latency
    # - Database transaction rate
    # - UI responsiveness
    # - Cache effectiveness

Safeguards Needed:
- Rate limiting per player
- Market order queue with backpressure
- Circuit breaker on database
- Degraded mode (delayed matching)
```

## Part V: Safety and Ethics

### 1. Blast Radius Control

**Start Small, Expand Gradually:**

```
Phase 1: Staging Environment
- Full chaos testing
- No player impact
- Learn and iterate

Phase 2: Production (1% of infrastructure)
- Canary servers
- Low-traffic times
- Heavy monitoring

Phase 3: Production (10% of infrastructure)
- Multiple servers
- Peak traffic testing
- Automated rollback

Phase 4: Production (Chaos Monkey - continuous)
- Random automated experiments
- 24/7 resilience testing
- Mature operations team
```

### 2. Player Communication

**Transparency About Experiments:**

```
Good Practice:
"We regularly test our infrastructure to ensure reliability. 
You may occasionally experience brief reconnections as we verify 
our systems can handle failures gracefully."

Bad Practice:
Running chaos experiments without any communication
(Players blame their internet, submit support tickets)

Best Practice:
- Add "system test in progress" indicator
- Communicate during scheduled GameDays
- Report results to community (builds trust)
```
