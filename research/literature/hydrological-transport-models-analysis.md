}
```

### Water Flow Simulation

**Surface Flow:**

Adapt SHETRAN's approach for local-scale player interaction:

```csharp
public class SurfaceFlowSimulator
{
    // 2D overland flow (simplified from SHETRAN 3D)
    public async Task<FlowField2D> SimulateOverlandFlow(
        TerrainGrid terrain,
        RainfallEvent rainfall,
        double duration)
    {
        var flowField = new FlowField2D(terrain.Width, terrain.Height);
        var timeSteps = (int)(duration / timeStepSize);
        
        for (int step = 0; step < timeSteps; step++)
        {
            // Calculate flow velocities based on slope and water depth
            for (int x = 0; x < terrain.Width; x++)
            {
                for (int y = 0; y < terrain.Height; y++)
                {
                    var cell = terrain[x, y];
                    var slope = terrain.CalculateSlope(x, y);
                    var depth = flowField.WaterDepth[x, y];
                    
                    // Manning's equation for overland flow
                    var velocity = CalculateVelocity(slope, depth, cell.Roughness);
                    flowField.Velocity[x, y] = velocity;
                    
                    // Route water to downslope neighbors
                    await RouteWaterDownslope(x, y, flowField, terrain);
                }
            }
            
            // Add rainfall for this timestep
            flowField.AddRainfall(rainfall.GetIntensity(step * timeStepSize));
            
            // Remove infiltration
            await ApplyInfiltration(flowField, terrain);
        }
        
        return flowField;
    }
    
    private double CalculateVelocity(double slope, double depth, double roughness)
    {
        // Manning's equation: v = (1/n) * R^(2/3) * S^(1/2)
        // For wide shallow flow: R ≈ depth
        return (1.0 / roughness) * Math.Pow(depth, 0.667) * Math.Sqrt(slope);
    }
}
```

### Sediment Transport

        MaterialProperties material)
    {
        // Simplified transport capacity (SHETRAN uses more complex formulas)
        var shearStress = waterDepth * flowVelocity * flowVelocity;
        var criticalShearStress = material.CriticalShearStress;
        
        if (shearStress < criticalShearStress)
            return 0.0;
        
        // Excess shear stress determines transport
        var excessStress = shearStress - criticalShearStress;
        return material.TransportCoefficient * excessStress;
    }
    
    public async Task<SedimentLoad> ProcessSedimentTransport(

    {
        var transportCapacity = CalculateTransportCapacity(
            segment.Velocity,
            segment.Depth,
            segment.BedMaterial);
        
        var currentLoad = inflowLoad.TotalMass;
        
        if (currentLoad > transportCapacity)
        {
            // Deposition occurs
            var deposited = currentLoad - transportCapacity;
            await segment.DepositSediment(deposited, inflowLoad.GetComposition());
            return new SedimentLoad(transportCapacity, inflowLoad.GetComposition());
        }
        else
        {
            // Potential for erosion
            var deficit = transportCapacity - currentLoad;

        RainfallEvent storm,
        TimeSpan duration)
    {
        var responses = new Dictionary<Subbasin, Hydrograph>();
        
        // Simulate each subbasin (HEC-HMS approach)
        foreach (var subbasin in _subbasins)
        {
            // Precipitation loss (infiltration)
            var effectiveRainfall = ApplyCurveNumberMethod(
                storm,
                subbasin.CurveNumber,
                subbasin.InitialAbstraction);
            
            // Transform to runoff hydrograph
            var hydrograph = ApplyUnitHydrograph(
                effectiveRainfall,
                subbasin.TimeOfConcentration,
                subbasin.Area);
            
            // Add baseflow
            hydrograph.AddBaseflow(subbasin.BaseflowRate);
            
            responses[subbasin] = hydrograph;
        }
        
        // Route through stream network
        var outletHydrograph = await RouteFlowsToOutlet(responses, _network);
        
        return new WatershedResponse
        {
            SubbasinHydrographs = responses,
            OutletHydrograph = outletHydrograph,
            PeakFlow = outletHydrograph.PeakDischarge,
            TimeOfPeak = outletHydrograph.TimeOfPeak
        };
    }
    
    private double ApplyCurveNumberMethod(
        RainfallEvent storm,
        double curveNumber,
        double initialAbstraction)
    {
        // SCS Curve Number method (used in HEC-HMS and SWAT)
        var S = 25.4 * (1000.0 / curveNumber - 10.0); // Retention (mm)
        var Ia = initialAbstraction * S; // Initial abstraction
        var P = storm.TotalDepth; // Precipitation
        
        if (P <= Ia)
            return 0.0;
        
        var Q = Math.Pow(P - Ia, 2) / (P - Ia + S);
        return Q;
    }
}
```

        for (int day = 1; day <= 365; day++)
        {
            var date = new DateTime(year, 1, 1).AddDays(day - 1);
            var dailyClimate = climate.GetDay(date);
            
            // Daily water balance (SWAT approach)
            var precipitation = dailyClimate.Precipitation;
            var potentialET = dailyClimate.PotentialET;
            
            // Surface runoff
            var runoff = CalculateRunoff(precipitation, soilMoisture, watershed);
            
            // Infiltration
            var infiltration = precipitation - runoff;
            soilMoisture += infiltration;
            
            // Evapotranspiration
            var actualET = Math.Min(potentialET, soilMoisture);

### Environmental Education

**Model Transparency:**

Show players the underlying hydrology:

```csharp
public class HydrologicalVisualization
{
    public void DisplayWaterBalance(Region region)
    {
        // SWAT-style water balance diagram
        var balance = region.CurrentWaterBalance;
        
        UI.ShowDiagram(new WaterBalanceDiagram
        {
            Inputs = new[]
            {
                ("Precipitation", balance.Precipitation),
                ("Upstream Inflow", balance.Inflow)
            },
            Outputs = new[]
            {
                ("Evapotranspiration", balance.ET),
                ("Surface Runoff", balance.Runoff),
                ("Groundwater Recharge", balance.Recharge),
                ("Downstream Outflow", balance.Outflow)
            },
            Storage = new[]
            {
                ("Soil Moisture", balance.SoilWater),
                ("Groundwater", balance.Groundwater),
                ("Surface Water", balance.SurfaceWater)
            }
        });
    }
    
    public void ShowSedimentBudget(RiverReach reach)
    {
        // SHETRAN-style sediment tracking
        var budget = reach.SedimentBudget;
        
        UI.ShowDiagram(new SedimentBudgetDiagram
        {
            Sources = new[]
            {
                ("Upstream Input", budget.UpstreamLoad),
                ("Bank Erosion", budget.BankErosion),
                ("Bed Erosion", budget.BedErosion)
            },
            Sinks = new[]
            {
                ("Deposition", budget.Deposition),
                ("Downstream Export", budget.DownstreamExport)
            },
            NetChange = budget.NetStorageChange
        });
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

**Adaptive Detail Levels:**

```csharp
public class AdaptiveHydrology
{
    // Near player: detailed SHETRAN-style simulation
    public async Task UpdateDetailedRegion(PlayerLocation player)
    {
        var detailRadius = 1000; // meters
        var cells = GetCellsInRadius(player.Position, detailRadius);
        
        foreach (var cell in cells)
        {
            // Full 3D simulation
            await UpdateCellHydrology3D(cell, timeStep: 1.0); // 1 second
        }
    }
    
    // Mid-range: subbasin HEC-HMS style
    public async Task UpdateSubbasins(List<Subbasin> subbasins)
    {
        foreach (var subbasin in subbasins)
        {
            // Lumped simulation
            await UpdateSubbasinLumped(subbasin, timeStep: 300.0); // 5 minutes
        }
    }
    
    // Far away: SWAT daily balance
    public async Task UpdateRemoteRegions(List<Region> regions)
    {
        foreach (var region in regions)
        {
            // Daily water balance only
            await UpdateRegionWaterBalance(region, timeStep: 86400.0); // 1 day
        }
    }
}
```
