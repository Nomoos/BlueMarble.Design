# Research Index

Master index of all research notes, experiments, and sources for the BlueMarble project.

## Topics

Research topics are small, focused notes on specific areas of interest. Each topic is self-contained
and typically 200-400 lines.

- [Topic files](topics/) - Individual research topics

## Experiments

Structured experiment logs documenting hypotheses, methods, results, and decisions.

- [Experiment logs](experiments/) - Dated experiment reports

## Sources

Bibliography, reading lists, and raw notes from external sources.

- [sources.bib](sources/sources.bib) - Bibliography
- [Reading List](sources/reading-list.md) - Curated reading list
- [Quotes](sources/quotes.md) - Notable quotes and excerpts

## Existing Research Areas

For comprehensive research areas, see:

- [Spatial Data Storage](spatial-data-storage/) - Spatial data storage strategies
- [Game Design](game-design/) - Game design research and analysis
- [GPT Research](gpt-research/) - Research from AI conversations

## Contributing

When adding research:

1. Keep notes small and focused (one topic per file)
2. Use kebab-case filenames
3. Include front matter with metadata
4. Cross-link related research
5. Update this index

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
