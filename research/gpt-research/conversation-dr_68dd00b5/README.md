## Overview

This Czech-language research explores modern MMORPG design patterns for offline progression, automated gameplay mechanics, and player-driven narratives. It analyzes successful systems from EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Albion Online that allow players to make strategic progress without requiring constant active play.

## Key Topics

- **Real-Time Skill Training**: EVE Online's offline progression system
- **Companion/Crew Systems**: Automated task execution (SWTOR)
- **Timed Activities**: Construction, crafting, and production timers
- **Player-Driven Narratives**: Minimalist lore with emergent gameplay
- **Strategic Planning**: Queue management and time optimization
- **Automation Balance**: Supplementing active play without replacing it

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Direct Applications

1. **Research System**: Technology research that progresses in real-time
2. **Automated Mining**: Deploy extractors that gather resources offline
3. **Construction Timers**: Buildings/terraforming take real time to complete
4. **Exploration Probes**: Send scouts to distant regions
5. **Player Settlements**: Emergent politics and territory control

### Design Philosophy

- **Respect Player Time**: Progress doesn't require 24/7 presence
- **Strategic Depth**: Meaningful choices about resource allocation
- **Player Agency**: Automation executes, players decide
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Systems enable player-created narratives
