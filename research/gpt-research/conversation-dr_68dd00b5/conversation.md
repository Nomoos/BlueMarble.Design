## Conversation Summary

This conversation (in Czech) explores game design mechanics in modern MMORPGs and RPGs, with focus on automated gameplay systems, player-driven narratives, and persistent world mechanics.

## Key Topics Covered

### Automated Game Mechanics and Planning

**Real-Time Skill Training** (EVE Online model):
- Skills train in real-time even when player is offline
- Players plan training queues strategically
- Maintains long-term player engagement
- "Allows training skills in real time, even when player is logged off"

**Crew Skills System** (Star Wars: The Old Republic):
- Send companions on missions (crafting or gathering tasks)
- Companions return after set time with results
- Player plans tasks, then can focus on other activities
- Companion works automatically meanwhile

**Timed Activities**:
- Daily or periodic tasks
- Building construction taking real hours
- Item production with timers
- Keeps world active even without constant player intervention

**Design Balance**:
- Players should have meaningful choices for planning
- Must not feel like game "plays for them" too much
- Successful mechanics (EVE, SWTOR) give players strategic control
- Players decide when and what happens automatically
- Maintains sense of accomplishment for achieved progress

### Minimalist Story and Player-Created Narrative

**Player-Driven Stories**:
- Some MMORPGs minimize developer-created story
- Enable players to create their own narratives
- Supports deep roleplaying elements
- Promotes emergent gameplay

**Examples**:
- **Albion Online**: Only framework lore, main stories created by players
- Focus on guild politics, territory control, and economic warfare
- Emergent narratives from player interactions

### Persistent World Mechanics

**Offline Progression**:
- Systems that continue working when player is offline
- Real-time training, timed crafting, companion missions
- Keeps players invested long-term

**Strategic Planning**:
- Players can optimize their progress through planning
- "Always have some skill in training queue" philosophy
- Resource management and time optimization

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Design Implications

1. **Offline Progression Systems**: Consider implementing mechanics that allow progress when players are not actively playing
   - Resource gathering automation
   - Base construction/terraforming with timers
   - Technology research that progresses in real-time

2. **Player-Driven Narratives**: BlueMarble's planet-scale world naturally supports emergent gameplay
   - Territory control and faction politics
   - Player-created settlements and civilizations
   - Economic systems driven by player actions

3. **Strategic Planning**: Allow players to queue actions and optimize their progression
   - Mining operations that run while offline
   - Construction projects with time requirements
   - Research trees that train automatically

### Balance Considerations

- Must not make game feel like "idle game"
- Players should feel agency and accomplishment
- Strategic choices should matter
- Automated systems supplement, not replace, active gameplay

## Context
