## Context

This conversation discusses refactoring the GitHub labels configuration for the
BlueMarble.Design repository. The goal is to improve the organization, clarity, and automation
of labels used for issues and pull requests.

### Current Label Structure

The repository currently uses:

1. **Auto-labeling via labeler.yml**:
   - `research` - for files in research/**
   - `design` - for files in design/**
   - `roadmap` - for files in roadmap/**
   - `roadmap-guides` - for files in roadmap-guides/**
   - `templates` - for files in templates/**
   - `documentation` - for docs/** and markdown files
   - `ci` - for .github/workflows/**
   - `infrastructure` - for .github/**, scripts/**, and config files

2. **Issue Template Labels**:
   - `bug` - Bug reports
   - `chore` - Maintenance tasks
   - `design` - Design work
   - `research` - Research tasks
   - `infrastructure` - Infrastructure items
   - `epic` - Large initiatives
   - `parent` - Parent tracking issues

3. **PR Size Labels** (automated):
   - `xs` (0-10 lines)
   - `s` (11-50 lines)
   - `m` (51-200 lines)
   - `l` (201-500 lines)
   - `xl` (500+ lines)

### Topics Covered

- Label organization and naming conventions
