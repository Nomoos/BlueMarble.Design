## Overview

This research examines Blizzard Entertainment's evolution from peer-to-peer (P2P) networking to server-authoritative architectures. It provides critical insights into why server-centric models are essential for cheat-resistant multiplayer games and persistent shared worlds.

### Key Findings

The research demonstrates a clear progression:
1. **Diablo I** - Asynchronous P2P (completely vulnerable to cheating)
2. **StarCraft/Warcraft** - Synchronous lockstep P2P (prevents action cheats but vulnerable to information reveals)
3. **Diablo II/WoW** - Server-authoritative (effective cheat prevention)

The analysis concludes that only server-authoritative architecture provides adequate protection for persistent multiplayer games, despite higher operational costs.

## Key Topics

- **Network Architecture Patterns**: P2P vs Client-Server models
- **Cheat Prevention**: Evolution of anti-cheat strategies
- **Information Control**: Server-side data hiding techniques
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Infrastructure costs vs. game integrity
- **Best Practices**: "Clients can't do anything they're not supposed to, and can't see anything they're not supposed to see"

## Relevance to BlueMarble

This research is **critical** for BlueMarble's architecture decisions:

### Direct Applications

1. **Server-Authoritative Required**: BlueMarble's planet-scale persistent world must use server-authoritative architecture to prevent:
   - Terrain modification cheats
   - Resource duplication
   - Impossible building placements
   - X-ray vision into hidden voxel data

2. **Information Hiding Strategy**: Server should only send voxel data for player's local area (500m-2km radius):
   - Reduces bandwidth requirements
   - Prevents reconnaissance cheats
   - Enables progressive detail loading
   - Essential for performance at planet scale

3. **Validation Layer**: All player actions must be validated server-side:
   - Mining rates
   - Building permissions
   - Resource collection
   - Terrain modifications

### Architecture Implications

- **Cost Planning**: Must budget for server infrastructure
- **Latency Management**: Need client-side prediction for smooth gameplay
- **Scalability**: Spatial partitioning and distributed servers required
- **Regional Deployment**: Consider server locations for global player base
