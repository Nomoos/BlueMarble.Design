## Overview

This Czech-language research proposes a comprehensive "learn by doing" attribute system with four main categories (Might, Dexterity, Mind, Presence) and twelve sub-aspects. The system enables natural character progression through gameplay activities without manual point allocation, supporting flexible character builds and diverse play styles.

## Key Topics

- **Four Main Attributes**: Might, Dexterity, Mind, Presence
- **Sub-Aspects**: Three specializations per main attribute
- **Activity-Based Progression**: Skills improve through use
- **Pool System**: Attributes as resource pools
- **Flexible Builds**: No class restrictions
- **Natural Development**: Character mirrors player actions

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Character Progression

1. **Mining** → Improves Might (strength, stamina)
2. **Building** → Develops Dexterity (coordination, fine motor skills)
3. **Exploration** → Enhances Mind (perception, foresight)
4. **Trading/Diplomacy** → Boosts Presence (persuasion, leadership)

### Design Benefits

- Supports sandbox gameplay naturally
- No artificial leveling grind
- Encourages trying different activities
- Rewards diverse playstyles
- Perfect for MMO with multiple gameplay loops
