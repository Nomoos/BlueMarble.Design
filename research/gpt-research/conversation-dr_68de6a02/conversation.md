## Conversation Summary

This Czech-language conversation presents a comprehensive design for a skill and attribute system for an RPG/MMORPG game. It proposes a pool-based progression system with four main attributes, each containing multiple sub-aspects that develop through player actions.

## Key Topics Covered

### Main Character Attributes (Hlavní atributy)

The system proposes four primary attributes that develop independently based on performed activities:

#### 1. **Might (Fyzická síla)** - Physical Strength
Represents physical fitness with three aspects:
- **Raw Strength** (Hrubá síla): Ability to exert great force
  - Lifting heavy loads
  - Attacks with heavy weapons
- **Stamina** (Vytrvalost): Resistance to fatigue and physical exertion
  - Running, working, combat endurance
- **Robustness** (Robustnost): Overall health and resilience
  - Resistance to diseases, poisons, injuries

#### 2. **Dexterity (Obratnost)** - Agility
Encompasses speed and movement skill:
- **Speed** (Rychlost): Reflexes, running, acceleration, reaction time
- **Fine Motor Skills** (Jemná motorika): Precision and dexterity
  - Acrobatics, manual work, lockpicking
- **Coordination** (Koordinace): Accuracy and movement harmony
  - Aiming when shooting, throwing, dodging attacks

#### 3. **Mind (Rozum)** - Mental Abilities
Covers intellectual capabilities:
- **Intelligence** (Inteligence): Logical thinking, learning, planning
- **Perception** (Vnímání): Attention and sensory awareness
  - Noticing details, environmental awareness
- **Foresight** (Předvídavost): Strategic thinking, situation assessment, adapting to changes

#### 4. **Presence (Charisma)** - Social Abilities
Concerns social and leadership capabilities:
- **Leadership** (Vůdcovství): Ability to lead others and motivate them
- **Persuasion** (Přesvědčování): Art of speech, negotiation, trading, social skills
- **Morale/Mental Resilience** (Morálka/Duševní odolnost): Inner strength, courage, willpower to resist psychological pressure

### Progression System Design

**Activity-Based Development**:
- Attributes improve through performing related actions
- No manual point distribution
- Natural progression through gameplay
- "Learn by doing" philosophy

**Pool System**:
- Each main attribute acts as a resource pool
- Sub-aspects draw from their parent attribute
- Broad attributes enable flexibility in character development
- Specialization happens naturally through play style

### Design Philosophy

**Natural Progression**:
- Character development mirrors player's activities
- No artificial skill trees or point allocation
- Organic growth based on what player actually does
- Encourages diverse gameplay

**Flexible Specialization**:
- Players can develop multiple aspects
- No hard class restrictions
- Allows hybrid character builds
- Adapts to player preferences

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Character Progression Design

1. **Activity-Based Growth**: Perfect for sandbox planet exploration
   - Mining improves physical strength
   - Building develops coordination
   - Resource management enhances intelligence
   - Trading boosts social skills

2. **Natural Skill Development**: No arbitrary leveling
   - Actions naturally improve related abilities
   - Terraforming develops relevant physical/mental skills
   - Exploration increases perception and foresight

3. **Flexible Specialization**: Support diverse play styles
   - Combat-focused players
   - Builder/engineer types
   - Traders and diplomats
   - Explorer specialists

### Implementation Considerations

**Attribute Tracking**:
- Server tracks all player actions
- Actions contribute to relevant attribute pools
- Gradual, continuous improvement
- No discrete "level up" events

**Balance**:
- Prevent grinding single activities
- Diminishing returns for repetition
- Encourage diverse gameplay
- Multiple paths to similar outcomes

**Social Systems**:
- Presence/Charisma attributes support
  - Guild leadership mechanics
  - Trading and negotiation
  - Territory politics
  - Player reputation

## Context

This conversation proposes a comprehensive attribute and skill system based on natural progression through gameplay activities. The four-attribute model (Might, Dexterity, Mind, Presence) with sub-aspects provides depth while remaining accessible. The pool-based "learn by doing" approach encourages organic character development that reflects player choices and play style.

## Design Principles

1. **Learn by Doing**: Skills improve through use
2. **Broad Categories**: Four main attributes with sub-aspects
3. **Natural Progression**: No manual point allocation
4. **Flexible Builds**: No hard class restrictions
5. **Activity-Based**: Character mirrors player actions
6. **Pool System**: Attributes as resource pools for sub-skills
