# Analysis: Temporal Simulation for Planet-Scale Worlds

## Executive Summary

This analysis provides a framework for simulating a planet-sized game world efficiently through hierarchical time management and event-driven processing. The core insight is that not all regions require continuous high-fidelity simulation - only areas with player activity need real-time updates. By combining multi-scale ticks, event scheduling, and lazy simulation, BlueMarble can achieve responsive gameplay while managing an Earth-sized world. This approach is essential for making planet-scale simulation computationally feasible.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Multi-Scale Temporal Resolution**

Fast updates for local gameplay, slow updates for global processes.

**Implementation**: 
- Player area: Frame-rate updates (60Hz)
- Nearby regions: Second-scale updates (1Hz)
- Distant regions: Minute-scale (0.016Hz)
- Global processes: Hour/day scale

**Relevance to BlueMarble**: Voxel modifications need fast updates nearby, but distant terrain can update slowly.

### 2. **Event-Driven Efficiency**

Idle regions consume zero resources until something happens.

**Benefits**:
- Priority queue manages all future events
- Entities schedule their next action
- Regions sleep until triggered
- Scales to planet size naturally

**Relevance to BlueMarble**: With millions of chunks, most are idle. Event-driven simulation makes this feasible.

### 3. **Lazy Simulation & Fast-Forward**

Unvisited regions don't simulate continuously - catch up when needed.

**Techniques**:
- Checkpoint state when player leaves
- Fast-forward using statistical models
- Deterministic replay for consistency
- Aggregate models for background populations

**Relevance to BlueMarble**: Geological processes (erosion, plant growth) can fast-forward when re-entering region.

### 4. **Spatial Event Propagation**

Events cascade through spatial hierarchy.

**Example**: Volcano eruption → Climate change → Resource availability → Population migration

**Implementation**: Events propagate up/down quadtree to affected regions.

**Relevance to BlueMarble**: Player terraforming affects nearby chunks, geological events have regional impact.

## Recommendations

### Critical Path

1. **Event Scheduling System** (Week 1-2)
   - Global priority queue for events
   - Entities can schedule future actions
   - Event cancellation/rescheduling support

2. **Multi-Resolution Update Loop** (Week 3-4)
   - Fast tick for player's chunk cluster
   - Medium tick for nearby regions
   - Slow tick for distant regions
   - Macro tick for global processes

3. **Region Sleep/Wake Logic** (Week 5-6)
   - Checkpoint region state on last player exit
   - Fast-forward on first player entry
   - Scheduled events processed during sleep

### Performance Optimization

1. **Spatial Indexing**: Quadtree for efficient event propagation
2. **Event Batching**: Group nearby events for efficiency
3. **Statistical Models**: Aggregate simulation for dormant regions
4. **Deterministic Systems**: Enable predictable fast-forward
