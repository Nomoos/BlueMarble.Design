## Overview

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of simulating a planet-sized game world: balancing fine-grained local simulation with coarse-grained global processes while remaining performant. The solution combines hierarchical time management, event-driven processing, and lazy simulation for inactive regions.

## Key Topics

- **Multi-Scale Ticks**: Different update rates by proximity (frames for nearby, hours for distant)
- **Event Scheduling**: Discrete-event simulation with priority queue
- **Lazy Simulation**: Fast-forward inactive regions using statistical models
- **Spatial Propagation**: Events cascade through quadtree hierarchy
- **LOD Simulation**: Level-of-detail for computational resources

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Core Architecture

This research is **essential** for making planet-scale simulation feasible:

1. **Computational Efficiency**: Only simulate active areas at high resolution
2. **Event-Driven Processing**: Idle chunks consume zero CPU
3. **Multi-Scale Updates**: 
   - Player area: 60 FPS
   - Nearby: 1 Hz
   - Distant: 1/60 Hz
   - Global: 1/3600 Hz (hourly)

### Implementation Benefits

- **Scales to Earth Size**: Can handle millions of chunks
- **Responsive Gameplay**: Fast updates where it matters
- **Background Processes**: Geological/climate events at appropriate scale
- **Resource Efficient**: CPU scales with active player count, not world size

## Integration Points

### Chunk Management
- Each chunk has update frequency based on distance from players
- Chunks sleep when no events scheduled
- Wake up when player approaches or event triggers

### Event System
- Global priority queue for all future events
- Voxel modifications as events
- Resource spawning as scheduled events
- Geological processes as macro-scale events

### Performance
- Reduces simulation load by 99%+ for distant regions
- Enables planet-scale world to run on realistic hardware
- Player experience remains smooth and responsive
