## Overview

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of partitioning a planetary game world across multiple servers through geographic sharding. The core strategy combines fixed spatial zones with dynamic load-driven partitioning to handle uneven player distribution and prevent server hotspots.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Spatial Partitioning Strategies

**Fixed Spatial Tiles (Static Zones)**:
- Divide globe into predetermined zones/tiles
- Each server permanently owns its tile
- Minimizes inter-server coordination
- Low boundary latency
- Simplifies routing
- Contains full authoritative state

**Limitation**: Cannot handle load imbalance - hotspots have no relief

**Dynamic, Load-Driven Partitioning**:
- Adjust region boundaries based on player density/load
- Use space-partitioning trees (kd-tree) with dynamic split lines
- "Micro-cells" that migrate between servers
- Offload busy areas by creating smaller zones
- Expand idle zones elsewhere

**Trade-off**: Requires extra bookkeeping and cross-server messaging, but smooths hotspots

### 2. Boundary Management (Entity Handovers)

When player/NPC moves between server regions, use **lock-and-transfer protocol**:

**Handover Process**:
1. **Lock**: Source server locks entity and surrounding area
2. **Transfer**: Send complete entity state including last processed action ID
3. **Forward**: New player actions forwarded to target server
4. **Sync**: Target server locks region, replays buffered events to catch up
5. **Accept**: Target accepts connection only after consistency achieved
6. **Switch**: Client instructed to connect to new server

**Result**: No updates lost, minimal interruption, ordered event processing

### 3. Dynamic Resharding (Hotspot Handling)

**Process for handling overloaded regions**:

1. **Identify Hotspot**: Monitor server load (players, tick rate, CPU)
2. **Allocate New Server**: Assign congested subarea to new/underutilized server
3. **Migrate State**: Serialize and stream objects, terrain, NPC state
4. **Activate**: New server begins simulating sub-region
5. **Update Boundaries**: Original server stops simulating moved area
6. **Subscribe Neighbors**: Both servers subscribe to border events temporarily
7. **Merge When Idle**: Consolidate resources when load declines

**Key Feature**: Seamless - clients see minimal delay during handoff

### 4. Case Studies & Best Practices

**Industry Examples**:
- **World-level sharding**: Each server runs entire copy of world
- **Mega-shard distributed**: Single unified world on distributed backend
- **Dual Universe**: Single-shard continuous voxel universe with adaptive LOD

**Research Insights**:
- Static zoning must pair with dynamic load-balancing
- Fixed cell partitions have "severe limitation in granularity"
- Kd-tree adjusts splits when server overloaded
- Dynamic reorganization enables virtually unlimited scalability

**Recommendations**:
- Start with base tiling (hexagonal or quadtree sectors)
- Implement robust handoff logic for border crossing
- Track server utilization continuously
- Use automated triggers for capacity thresholds
- Split overloaded zones, merge low-load regions
- **Hybrid approach best**: Fixed tiles for low-overhead routing + dynamic reshaping around player clusters

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Critical Architecture Decisions

1. **Spatial Partitioning**: BlueMarble's planet-scale world requires geo-sharding
   - Fixed base tiles aligned with coordinate system
   - Dynamic splitting for player hotspots (cities, war zones, events)

2. **Server Scaling**: Elastic capacity for variable player density
   - Automated hotspot detection
   - On-demand server allocation
   - Seamless state migration

3. **Boundary Handling**: Smooth player transitions between regions
   - Lock-and-transfer protocol prevents state loss
   - Ordered event processing maintains consistency
   - Client switching minimizes disruption

### Implementation Requirements

**Infrastructure**:
- Server orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Load monitoring and metrics
- State serialization system
- Inter-server messaging (event bus)

**Data Management**:
- Spatial indexing (quadtree/Morton codes)
- State snapshots for migration
- Event logs for synchronization
- Boundary subscription system

**Performance Targets**:
- Handover latency < 500ms
- State migration without gameplay interruption
- Automated resharding within 30s of threshold
- Support 10,000+ concurrent players

### Design Patterns

1. **Fixed + Dynamic Hybrid**: Best balance of simplicity and flexibility
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track load, player density, tick rates
3. **Proactive Splitting**: Split before overload, not during crisis
4. **Graceful Merging**: Consolidate resources during off-peak
5. **Border Buffering**: Temporary event subscription prevents data loss

## Technical Specifications

### Partitioning Strategy

**Base Tiling**:
- Quadtree or hexagonal grid
- Tile size: 10-50km (adjustable)
- Morton/Hilbert encoding for locality

**Dynamic Splits**:
- Trigger: >80% server capacity or >5000 players/tile
- Split algorithm: Kd-tree along player density gradient
- New tile size: 50% of parent (recursive)

**Merge Conditions**:
- Combined load <40% capacity
- No boundary conflicts
- Player count allows consolidation

### Handover Protocol

```
Source Server:
1. Lock entity + 100m radius
2. Serialize state (position, inventory, buffs, action queue)
3. Send state + last_action_id to target
4. Forward incoming actions

Target Server:
1. Lock receiving region
2. Apply state snapshot
3. Replay buffered actions (last_action_id+1..current)
4. Validate consistency
5. Accept player connection
6. Notify source (handover complete)

Client:
1. Receive new server address
2. Disconnect from source
3. Connect to target
4. Resume gameplay
```

### State Migration

**Data to Transfer**:
- Entity components (Transform, Physics, Health, Inventory)
- Terrain deltas (if modified)
- Active quests/missions
- Faction relationships
- Trade/economy state
- NPC states within boundary

**Transfer Protocol**:
- Compressed binary (Protocol Buffers)
- Incremental streaming for large states
- Checksum validation
- Rollback on failure
