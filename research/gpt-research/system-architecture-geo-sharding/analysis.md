# Analysis: Geo-Sharded Server Architecture

## Executive Summary

This research provides the blueprint for BlueMarble's distributed server architecture. The hybrid approach (fixed base tiles + dynamic resharding) enables planet-scale simulation while handling variable player density. Key insight: static partitioning alone fails under load, but pure dynamic partitioning adds too much overhead - the solution is a pragmatic hybrid that reshards only when needed.

## Key Insights

### 1. Hybrid Partitioning Model

**Pattern**: Start simple, add complexity only where needed
- Fixed tiles: O(1) routing, minimal coordination
- Dynamic splits: Only for hotspots (wars, events, cities)
- Best of both: Low baseline overhead + elastic capacity

**BlueMarble Application**: Use quadtree base tiles (10km) + split to 2.5km when >5000 players

### 2. Seamless Handovers Critical

**Lock-and-transfer protocol prevents**:
- Lost player actions during transition
- Inventory duplication exploits
- Position desync between servers
- Inconsistent game state

**Must Have**: Ordered event replay, last_action_id tracking, atomic handoff

### 3. Proactive vs Reactive Scaling

**Proactive** (recommended): Split at 80% capacity
- Time to allocate new server
- Migrate state gracefully
- No player impact

**Reactive**: Split at 100% capacity
- Emergency mode
- Degraded performance during migration
- Player-visible lag

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- [ ] Implement fixed quadtree partitioning
- [ ] Build lock-and-transfer handover protocol
- [ ] Create state serialization system
- [ ] Add load monitoring

### Phase 2: Dynamic Scaling (Months 4-6)
- [ ] Hotspot detection algorithm
- [ ] Automated server allocation (Kubernetes)
- [ ] State migration pipeline
- [ ] Boundary event subscription

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7+)
- [ ] Predictive split (ML-based player density forecasting)
- [ ] Cost optimization (merge idle regions)
- [ ] Cross-region optimization (neighbor caching)

## Implementation Priority

**Critical Path**: 
1. Fixed partitioning + handovers (enables multiplayer)
2. Load monitoring (prevents outages)
3. Dynamic splitting (handles scale)

**Performance Target**: Handover < 500ms, migration seamless
