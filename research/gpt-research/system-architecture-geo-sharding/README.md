## Overview

Blueprint for distributing BlueMarble's planetary simulation across multiple servers using geographic sharding. Combines fixed spatial zones with dynamic load-driven partitioning to handle uneven player distribution.

## Key Topics

- **Spatial Partitioning**: Fixed tiles + dynamic resharding hybrid
- **Boundary Management**: Lock-and-transfer handover protocol
- **Dynamic Resharding**: Automated hotspot handling
- **Case Studies**: Dual Universe single-shard architecture
- **Load Balancing**: Kd-tree adaptive partitioning

## Relevance to BlueMarble

### Critical for Scale

This research is **essential** for achieving planet-scale multiplayer:

1. **Fixed Base Tiles**: Quadtree partitioning (10km tiles)
2. **Dynamic Splits**: Auto-split at >5000 players or 80% CPU
3. **Seamless Handovers**: Lock-and-transfer prevents data loss
4. **Elastic Capacity**: Add/remove servers based on load

### Performance Requirements

- Handover latency < 500ms
- State migration without player impact
- Support 10,000+ concurrent players
- Automated resharding within 30s
