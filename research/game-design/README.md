## Research Philosophy

### Scientific Integrity First
All game mechanics must align with geological principles and maintain educational value. Players learn real-world geological concepts through gameplay.

### Intelligent Constraints
Limitations arise from geological reality, not arbitrary game rules. This creates discoverable logic that players can understand and work with creatively.

### Player Agency Through Knowledge
Understanding geology directly translates to expanded gameplay capabilities. Knowledge becomes the primary progression currency.

### Emergent Complexity
Simple, realistic rules interact to create complex, unpredictable opportunities and challenges.

## Integration with BlueMarble Architecture

### Backward Compatibility
All proposed changes extend existing systems without breaking current functionality:

```csharp
// Example: Extending existing WorldDetail constants
public static class Enhanced3DWorldDetail : WorldDetail
{
    // All existing constants remain unchanged
    // New 3D capabilities added as extensions
    public const long WorldSizeZ = 20000000L;
    public const long SeaLevelZ = WorldSizeZ / 2;
}
```
