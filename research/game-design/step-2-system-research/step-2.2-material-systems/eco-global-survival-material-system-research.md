## Eco Global Survival Overview

### Game Concept

Eco Global Survival is a global survival game where players must collaboratively build a civilization to prevent a meteor from destroying their world. The core tension comes from needing industrial technology to stop the meteor while avoiding environmental collapse from pollution and resource depletion.

### Core Design Philosophy

**"Every action has environmental consequences"** - Unlike traditional survival games where resources regenerate infinitely, Eco simulates a living ecosystem where over-harvesting causes species extinction, pollution damages soil fertility, and deforestation leads to erosion.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Collaborative Economy Required** - No single player can master all skills
2. **Government and Law Systems** - Players can vote on regulations and taxes
3. **Real-Time Ecosystem Simulation** - Animals reproduce, plants spread, pollution accumulates
4. **Educational Focus** - Used in classrooms to teach ecology and economics
5. **Time Pressure** - Meteor countdown creates urgency for technological advancement

## Material System Analysis

### Material Categories

Eco organizes materials into logical categories based on extraction source and processing requirements:

#### Raw Natural Resources

**Gathered from Environment:**
- **Plant Materials:** Wood (multiple tree species), Plant Fibers, Seeds, Fruits, Vegetables
- **Animal Products:** Meat, Hides, Furs, Bones, Feathers
- **Minerals:** Stone, Coal, Iron Ore, Copper Ore, Gold Ore, various rock types
- **Liquids:** Water (fresh/salt), Plant oils, Animal fats

**Environmental Variation:**
- Different biomes contain different species and materials
- Material abundance varies by location (copper common in mountains, less in plains)
- Climate affects plant growth rates and animal populations
- Soil quality impacts farming yields

#### Processed Materials

**Basic Processing (Early Game):**
```
Logs → Lumber (via Carpentry)
Stone → Hewn Logs (via Masonry)
Plant Fibers → Fabric (via Tailoring)
Iron Ore + Coal → Iron Bars (via Smelting)
Clay → Bricks (via Pottery)
```

**Advanced Processing (Mid-Late Game):**
```
Iron Bars → Steel Bars (via Advanced Smelting)
Lumber → Plywood (via Advanced Carpentry)
Stone → Concrete (via Engineering)
Various materials → Plastic (via Oil Processing)
Copper + Other metals → Electronics (via Electronics)
```

### Material Properties

Each material in Eco has distinct properties that affect its use:

#### Weight and Volume
- Affects carrying capacity and storage requirements
- Heavier materials require carts/vehicles for efficient transport
- Storage buildings have volume limits, forcing infrastructure planning

#### Durability and Efficiency
- Tools have durability that degrades with use
- Better materials create more durable tools
- Material quality affects processing efficiency

#### Environmental Cost
- **Pollution Generated:** Industrial materials create air/water pollution
- **Resource Intensity:** Some materials require extensive processing chains
- **Ecosystem Impact:** Extraction affects local environment

### Material Flow Example: Iron Production Chain

```
Iron Ore (Raw Material)
    ↓ [Mining - Environmental Cost: Habitat Destruction, Tailings]
Mine Output: Iron Ore + Stone byproduct
    ↓ [Smelting - Environmental Cost: Air Pollution, CO2]
Bloomery/Blast Furnace: Iron Ore + Coal → Iron Bars + Slag
    ↓ [Smithing - Environmental Cost: Minimal]
Anvil: Iron Bars → Iron Tools, Iron Plates, Iron Components
    ↓ [Advanced Manufacturing]
Assembly Line: Iron Components + Other Materials → Machinery, Vehicles

Environmental Impact Cascade:
- Mining: Removes vegetation, creates pit, generates tailings
- Transport: Vehicle emissions if using powered carts
- Smelting: Significant CO2 and air pollution
- Each step consumes calories (food) from workers
- Waste products need disposal or recycling
```

### Material Scarcity and Renewability

**Non-Renewable Resources:**
- **Minerals:** Finite deposits that deplete with extraction
- **Fossil Fuels:** Limited coal and oil reserves
- **Metals:** Cannot be regenerated, only recycled

**Renewable Resources:**
- **Plants:** Regrow if harvested sustainably, die if over-harvested
- **Animals:** Reproduce if populations maintained above threshold
- **Soil Fertility:** Regenerates slowly, depletes with intensive farming

**Critical Mechanic:** Resources don't respawn on timers—they follow ecological rules. Cut down all trees in an area, and they won't regrow without player intervention (replanting). Hunt a species to extinction, and it's gone permanently.

## Quality and Technology System

### Technology Tiers

Unlike traditional RPG quality systems (Common/Rare/Epic), Eco uses **technology tiers** that represent civilizational advancement:

#### Tier 1: Primitive (Basic)
- **Tools:** Wooden, Stone
- **Buildings:** Wood frames, dirt floors
- **Power:** Manual labor only
- **Example Items:** Stone Axe, Wooden Hoe, Hewn Log

#### Tier 2: Industrial (Advanced)
- **Tools:** Iron, Steel
- **Buildings:** Brick, lumber construction
- **Power:** Waterwheels, windmills
- **Example Items:** Iron Pickaxe, Iron Plow, Steel Tools

#### Tier 3: Modern
- **Tools:** Advanced steel, composite materials
- **Buildings:** Concrete, advanced infrastructure
- **Power:** Combustion engines, generators
- **Example Items:** Modern Axe, Powered Tools, Machinery

#### Tier 4: Future (Electronics/Automation)
- **Tools:** Automated systems, electronics
- **Buildings:** Modern infrastructure, climate control
- **Power:** Advanced generators, renewable energy
- **Example Items:** Laser, Computer Lab Equipment, Solar Panels

### Skill System and Specialization

**Skill Book System:**
Players choose professions and learn from skill books:

#### Gathering Professions
- **Hunting:** Animal tracking, butchering, leather working
- **Farming:** Crop cultivation, soil management, fertilization
- **Logging:** Tree felling, forest management
- **Mining:** Ore extraction, prospecting
- **Gathering:** Wild plant harvesting, foraging

#### Crafting Professions
- **Carpentry:** Woodworking, furniture, basic construction
- **Masonry:** Stone working, brick making, foundations
- **Smithing:** Metal tools, weapons, basic metalwork
- **Tailoring:** Clothing, fabric processing
- **Cooking:** Food preparation, calorie optimization

#### Advanced Professions
- **Engineering:** Advanced materials, concrete, infrastructure
- **Mechanics:** Vehicles, machinery, engines
- **Electronics:** Computers, automation, advanced technology
- **Industry:** Mass production, factories, efficiency

**Specialization Mechanics:**
- Players can only master 1-3 professions (server configurable)
- Each profession requires significant time investment
- Specialization creates economic niches and trade opportunities
- Teaching system allows transferring knowledge via skill books

### Quality Through Technology

Instead of "crafting quality" based on skill level, Eco uses **technological advancement**:

```
Wooden Pickaxe → Iron Pickaxe → Steel Pickaxe → Modern Pickaxe
     (Tier 1)        (Tier 2)       (Tier 3)        (Tier 4)

Differences:
- Durability: 50 → 200 → 500 → 1000 uses
- Efficiency: 1x → 2x → 4x → 8x mining speed
- Environmental Cost: Low → Medium → High → Medium (if renewable energy)
- Prerequisites: None → Iron+Coal → Steel+Technology → Electronics+Research
```

**Key Insight:** Quality advancement requires collaborative research and infrastructure rather than individual grinding.

## Resource Gathering and Processing

### Gathering Mechanics

#### Mining System

**Prospecting and Discovery:**
- World generates with randomized ore deposits
- Players must prospect (survey) to discover mineral locations
- Core samples reveal underground composition
- Richness varies—some deposits are more concentrated

**Extraction Process:**
1. **Survey Phase:** Use prospecting tools to locate deposits
2. **Infrastructure:** Build mine shaft, supports, access roads
3. **Extraction:** Mine blocks to obtain ore
4. **Processing:** Smelt ores into usable bars
5. **Cleanup:** Deal with tailings and environmental damage

**Environmental Considerations:**
- Mining creates permanent terrain changes
- Tailings (waste rock) must be managed
- Underground water can flood mines
- Structural collapse if insufficient support

#### Logging and Forestry

**Tree Harvesting:**
- Different tree species in different biomes
- Trees have age and size affecting yield
- Proper felling techniques maximize lumber
- Stumps remain and can be removed

**Forest Management:**
```
Sustainable Approach:
1. Survey forest composition
2. Selective logging (take mature trees)
3. Replanting to maintain coverage
4. Monitor regeneration rates

Result: Renewable lumber supply

Destructive Approach:
1. Clear-cut entire forest
2. No replanting
3. Soil erosion begins
4. Animals leave area (habitat loss)

Result: Permanent environmental damage, lumber shortage
```

**Reforestation Mechanics:**
- Players can plant saplings
- Trees grow over real-time (server time)
- Growth rate depends on climate and soil
- Old-growth forests provide ecosystem benefits

#### Hunting and Gathering

**Animal Population Dynamics:**
- Animals reproduce based on population and food availability
- Hunting reduces population
- Over-hunting below threshold causes species collapse
- Animals migrate to healthy habitats

**Sustainable Hunting:**
```
Healthy Population Management:
- Hunt mature animals, leave young
- Monitor population levels
- Maintain habitat (don't destroy all vegetation)
- Allow breeding cycles to complete

Result: Renewable food and material source

Over-hunting:
- Kill faster than reproduction rate
- Population drops below viability threshold
- Species goes extinct in region
- Predator-prey balance collapses

Result: Permanent food source loss
```

**Plant Gathering:**
Similar dynamics to hunting—plants spread via seeds if healthy populations maintained.

### Processing Systems

#### Multi-Stage Processing

Materials often require multiple processing stages:

**Example: Cotton to Clothing:**
```
Stage 1: Farming
- Prepare farmland (remove vegetation, till soil)
- Plant cotton seeds
- Irrigate and maintain (consumes calories)
- Harvest cotton
Environmental Cost: Soil depletion, water use

Stage 2: Fiber Processing
- Cotton → Plant Fibers (via Loom or by hand)
- Requires building (Loom) for efficiency
Environmental Cost: Minimal

Stage 3: Fabric Creation
- Plant Fibers → Fabric (via Tailoring Table)
- Can create different fabric types
Environmental Cost: Minimal

Stage 4: Clothing Production
- Fabric → Clothing items (via Tailoring)
- Different clothing types (labor clothes, specialty)
Environmental Cost: Minimal

Total Chain: 4 professions may be involved (Farmer, Miller, Tailor, Tailor)
```

#### Industrial Processing

**Steel Production (Complex Chain):**
```
Inputs Required:
- Iron Ore (Mining profession)
- Coal (Mining profession)  
- Limestone/Flux (Mining profession)
- Labor (calories consumed)

Processing Stages:
1. Ore Smelting: Iron Ore + Coal → Iron Bars + CO2 + Air Pollution
2. Flux Addition: Limestone for purification
3. Steel Making: Iron + Carbon → Steel Bars (Advanced Smelting)
4. Component Manufacturing: Steel Bars → Steel Products

Environmental Costs:
- Significant air pollution from smelting
- CO2 emissions contributing to climate change
- Slag waste requiring disposal
- High calorie consumption

Technology Gates:
- Requires Blast Furnace (advanced building)
- Needs steady supply of iron and coal
- Benefits from transportation infrastructure
```

### Efficiency and Optimization

**Technology Progression:**
Early game processing is manual and inefficient:
- Hand tools vs. powered machinery
- Small batch sizes vs. mass production
- High labor requirements vs. automation

Late game allows optimization:
- **Powered Tools:** 5-10x faster than hand tools
- **Assembly Lines:** Batch processing with reduced waste
- **Automation:** Minimal human intervention needed
- **Efficiency Research:** Unlocks reduced material requirements

**Trade-off:** Advanced technology requires higher initial resource investment and greater environmental impact during setup, but becomes more sustainable long-term with proper planning.

## Environmental Impact Mechanics

### Pollution Systems

Eco tracks multiple pollution types with distinct effects:

#### Air Pollution

**Sources:**
- Smelting operations (bloomeries, blast furnaces)
- Combustion engines (generators, vehicles)
- Burning waste
- Industrial manufacturing

**Effects:**
- Damages nearby plants
- Affects animal health in polluted areas
- Contributes to smog

- Accumulates in atmosphere

**Measurement:**
- Parts Per Million (PPM) in local atmosphere
- Visible smoke effects from polluting buildings
- Air quality ratings for regions
- Global atmospheric composition tracking

**Mitigation:**
- Scrubbers on industrial buildings (reduce but don't eliminate)
- Transitioning to renewable energy
- Spacing out polluting buildings
- Natural atmospheric clearing over time

#### Water Pollution

**Sources:**
- Tailings from mining dumped in water
- Runoff from farms (fertilizer)
- Waste disposal in waterways
- Industrial discharge

**Effects:**
- Kills aquatic life
- Damages water-dependent plants
- Contaminates drinking water
- Spreads downstream

**Measurement:**
- Water quality samples
- Visible pollution particles in water
- Fish population health indicators

**Mitigation:**
- Proper waste management systems
- Settling ponds for mine tailings
- Wetlands for natural filtration
- Avoiding waterway pollution

#### Ground Pollution

**Sources:**
- Buried garbage and waste
- Oil spills
- Excessive fertilizer use
- Tailings left on surface

**Effects:**
- Reduces soil fertility
- Prevents plant growth
- Affects underground water
- Long-term contamination

**Mitigation:**
- Composting organic waste
- Recycling materials
- Proper tailings management
- Phytoremediation (plants cleaning soil)

### Climate and Ecosystem Impact

#### Climate Change System

**Contributing Factors:**
- CO2 from smelting and combustion
- Methane from organic waste
- Deforestation reducing carbon sequestration
- Industrial expansion

**Observable Effects:**
- Temperature changes affecting biomes
- Sea level rise (in some configurations)
- Weather pattern changes
- Species migration or death

**Feedback Loops:**
- Higher temperatures → plant stress → less CO2 absorption → more warming
- Drought → forest fires → more CO2 → warming
- Ice melt → reduced albedo → more warming

#### Deforestation and Habitat Loss

**Chain of Effects:**
```
Clear-Cutting Forest
    ↓
Habitat Destruction
    ↓
Animal populations decline/migrate
    ↓
Soil erosion (no root systems)
    ↓
Reduced water retention
    ↓
Downstream flooding or drought
    ↓
Reduced biodiversity
    ↓
Ecosystem simplification
    ↓
System more vulnerable to collapse
```

**Real-Time Simulation:**
- Animals check for suitable habitat every game cycle
- Plants need proper conditions to spread
- Soil quality degrades without vegetation
- Effects cascade through food webs

#### Species Extinction

**Population Dynamics:**
Each species has:
- Minimum viable population
- Reproduction rate
- Food/habitat requirements
- Predator-prey relationships

**Extinction Cascade:**
```
Example: Hunting deer to extinction
1. Deer population drops below viability
2. Wolves (predator) lose food source → population crash
3. Plants deer ate recover unchecked → dominate area
4. Biodiversity reduced
5. No more deer-derived materials available

Result: Permanent ecosystem change, loss of resources
```

**Principle:** "Geological reality creates natural constraints that feel logical and educational rather than arbitrary game limitations."

### Recommendation 1: Implement Ecological Resource Layers

**Renewable Resources with Ecological Rules:**

```csharp
public class RenewableResourceSystem
{
    // Forest ecosystem simulation
    public class ForestEcosystem
    {
        // Population dynamics
        public Dictionary<TreeSpecies, Population> TreePopulations;
        public float SoilQuality; // Affected by erosion, depletion
        public float WaterAvailability;
        public int BiodiversityIndex;
        
        // Growth simulation
        public void SimulateGrowth(float deltaTime)
        {
            foreach (var species in TreePopulations)
            {
                float growthRate = CalculateGrowthRate(
                    species.Value,
                    SoilQuality,
                    WaterAvailability,
                    ClimateConditions
                );
                
                // Reproduction
                if (species.Value.Count > MinimumViablePopulation)
                {
                    species.Value.AddSaplings(growthRate * deltaTime);
                }
                
                // Natural death
                species.Value.RemoveAged(naturalMortalityRate);
            }
            
            // Soil recovery
            SoilQuality += ForestCoverageRate * SoilRegenerationRate * deltaTime;
        }
        
        // Harvest impact
        public bool TryHarvest(TreeSpecies species, int quantity, out HarvestResult result)
        {
            if (TreePopulations[species].Count < quantity)
            {

        Location location)
    {
        var result = new ProcessingResult();
        
        // Base processing
        result.OutputMaterial = method.Transform(input);
        result.Efficiency = method.BaseEfficiency * 
                           (1.0 + input.Quality / 100.0);
        
        // Environmental impact based on method
        switch (method.Type)
        {
            case ProcessingType.Smelting:
                // Air pollution from combustion
                result.AirPollution = CalculateSmeltingPollution(
                    input.Mass,
                    method.FuelType,
                    method.Temperature
                );
                // CO2 from carbon fuel
                result.CO2Emissions = input.Mass * method.CarbonIntensity;
                // Slag waste
                result.SolidWaste = input.Mass * (1.0 - input.Purity);

                cell.AirQuality -= result.AirPollution * cell.DistanceFactor;
                
                // Damage to vegetation
                if (cell.AirQuality < PlantHealthThreshold)
                {
                    cell.VegetationHealth *= 0.95; // Gradual damage
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Water pollution flows downstream
        if (result.WaterPollution > 0)
        {
            var watershed = GetWatershed(loc);
            PropagateWaterPollution(watershed, result.WaterPollution);
        }
        
        // Track global climate impact

            // Healthy wildlife
            SustainableFoodYield = health.AnimalPopulations.Sum(p => 
                p.Count > p.MinViable ? p.Count * 0.05 : 0),
            
            // Pollination services
            CropYieldBonus = health.PollinatorCount / 1000.0,
            
            // Climate regulation
            CarbonSequestration = health.ForestCoverage * 10.0,
            TemperatureModeration = health.VegetationCoverage * 0.2,
            
            // Economic value

        };
    }
    
    // Certification system
    public class SustainabilityRating
    {
        public int Stars; // 1-5 stars
        public List<string> Certifications;
        public float MarketPriceBonus; // Sustainable goods worth more
        
        public static SustainabilityRating Evaluate(ProductionChain chain)
        {

            if (chain.UsesNonRenewableResources) rating.Stars--;
            if (chain.CausedHabitatDestruction) rating.Stars--;
            if (chain.WastePercentage > 20) rating.Stars--;
            
            // Bonuses
            if (chain.UsesRenewableEnergy)
                rating.Certifications.Add("Renewable Energy");
            if (chain.RecyclesWaste)
                rating.Certifications.Add("Zero Waste");
            if (chain.RestoresHabitat)
                rating.Certifications.Add("Carbon Negative");
                
            // Economic benefit
            rating.MarketPriceBonus = 1.0 + (rating.Stars * 0.1);

- Quality calculation based on skill + materials + tools
- Success rates and critical successes

**Eco-Inspired Additions:**
- **Environmental Cost Tracking:** Each process has pollution/impact
- **Technology Tiers:** Basic/Advanced/Modern tool variants
- **Efficiency Progression:** Better technology = less waste + less pollution
- **Impact Mitigation Options:** Scrubbers, clean energy, recycling

### Technical Architecture

#### Data Structures

```csharp
// Environmental tracking at cell level
public class EnvironmentalCell
{
    // Existing geological data
    public MaterialComposition Geology;
    public int Elevation;
    
    // New environmental data
    public float AirQuality;
    public float WaterQuality;
    public float SoilHealth;
    public Dictionary<Species, int> PopulationCounts;
    public List<PollutionSource> ActivePolluters;
    
    // Climate
    public float Temperature;
    public float Precipitation;
    public float CO2_Local;
}

// Global environmental state
public class EnvironmentalSimulation
{
    public float GlobalCO2_PPM;
    public float GlobalTemperature;
    public float SeaLevel;
    public HashSet<Species> ExtinctSpecies;
    
    public void SimulateStep(float deltaTime)
    {
        // Update populations
        UpdateEcosystems(deltaTime);
        
        // Propagate pollution
        DiffusePollution(deltaTime);
        
        // Climate calculations
        UpdateClimate(deltaTime);
        
        // Check thresholds
        CheckExtinctions();
    }
}
```

#### Performance Considerations

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Spatial Partitioning:**
   - Only simulate active regions (near players)
   - Lower resolution for distant areas
   - Aggregate small pollution sources

2. **Update Frequency:**
   - Environmental simulation on slower tick rate (1 Hz vs. 60 Hz gameplay)
   - Population updates once per game day
   - Climate calculations once per season

3. **Approximation:**
   - Use simplified models for distant effects
   - Aggregate homogeneous regions
   - Cache frequently accessed environmental data

4. **Progressive Loading:**
   - Load environmental data on-demand
   - Unload inactive region data
   - Compress historical data

#### Multiplayer Synchronization

**Environmental State Sharing:**

```csharp
public class EnvironmentalSync
{
    // Server authoritative
    public void BroadcastEnvironmentalUpdate()
    {
        var update = new EnvironmentalUpdate
        {
            Timestamp = ServerTime.Now,
            GlobalMetrics = GetGlobalMetrics(),
            RegionalChanges = GetSignificantChanges(),
            SpeciesEvents = GetExtinctionsAndRecoveries()
        };
        
        SendToAllClients(update);
    }
    
    // Clients receive updates
    public void ApplyEnvironmentalUpdate(EnvironmentalUpdate update)
    {
        // Update local environment representation
        GlobalEnvironment.Apply(update.GlobalMetrics);
        
        foreach (var change in update.RegionalChanges)
        {
            LocalEnvironment[change.CellId].Apply(change);
        }
        
        // Notify UI of significant events
        if (update.SpeciesEvents.Any())
        {
            NotifyPlayer(update.SpeciesEvents);
        }
    }
}
```

- 101-200 PPM: Unhealthy (plant growth -30%, animal health -10%)
- 201-500 PPM: Very Unhealthy (plant growth -60%, animal health -30%)
- 500+ PPM: Hazardous (plants dying, animals fleeing/dying)

**Population Viability Thresholds:**
- Small Animals (rabbits, birds): Minimum 50 individuals
- Medium Animals (deer, wolves): Minimum 20 individuals
- Large Animals (elk, bears): Minimum 10 individuals
- Below threshold: Population collapses to extinction

**Climate Change Thresholds:**
- 0-1°C warming: Minimal effects
- 1-2°C warming: Species range shifts, some crop failures
- 2-3°C warming: Significant biome changes, frequent extreme weather
- 3°C+ warming: Widespread ecosystem collapse

### Appendix C: Comparative Material Processing Chains

**Eco Global Survival: Iron Production**
```
Iron Ore (Mining) 
  → Bloomery (Basic Smelting) → Iron Bars
  → Anvil (Smithing) → Iron Tools
  
Environmental Cost:
- Mining: Habitat destruction, tailings
- Smelting: High air pollution, CO2
- Smithing: Minimal

Tech Requirements: Basic (Tier 1)
Specialists Needed: Miner, Smelter, Smith (3 professions)
```

**BlueMarble (Current): Iron Production**
```
Geological Survey (Prospecting)
  → Mine Iron Ore (Mining skill)
  → Smelt to Iron Ingots (Smelting skill)
  → Forge Iron Tools (Blacksmithing skill)
  
Quality Factors:
- Ore quality from geological formation
- Processing skill affects yield
- Tool quality affects final product

Tech Requirements: None (skill-based)
Specialists Needed: Can be one player
```

**Recommended BlueMarble (Enhanced): Iron Production**
```
Geological Survey (Geologist profession)
  → Mine Iron Ore (Miner profession)
    ├─ Environmental Impact: Tailings, habitat disturbance
  → Smelt to Iron Ingots (Smelter profession)
    ├─ Environmental Impact: Air pollution, CO2, slag waste
    ├─ Technology Tier: Basic/Advanced/Clean (affects pollution)
  → Forge Iron Tools (Blacksmith profession)
    ├─ Quality from: Ore + Processing + Skill + Tools
    └─ Environmental Impact: Minimal

Tech Requirements: None for Basic, Research for Advanced/Clean
Specialists Needed: Solo viable (slower), multiplayer optimal (3-4 players)
Environmental Tracking: Pollution levels affect local ecosystem health
Sustainability Path: Unlock clean smelting technology to reduce impact
```

### Appendix D: Skill Specialization Models

**Standard MMORPG (e.g., World of Warcraft):**
- Can eventually master all professions (time-gated)
- No forced specialization
- Trade for convenience, not necessity

**Eco Global Survival:**
- Hard cap at 1-3 professions (server configurable)
- Impossible to self-sustain at higher tech levels
- Trade is mandatory for advanced items

**Recommended BlueMarble (Hybrid):**
- Soft cap via skill point system (100 points total)
- Master profession costs 40 points (2.5 max)
- Solo viable but slower and less specialized
- Multiplayer enables mastery + efficiency
- Advanced projects benefit greatly from specialists
