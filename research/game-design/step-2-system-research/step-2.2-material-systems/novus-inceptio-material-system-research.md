**Implementation Notes:**
```
Quality Retention System:
Stage 1: Ore Extraction
- Input: Geological formation (quality 0-100%)
- Process: Mining skill + tools
- Output: Raw ore (quality retained: 70-120% based on skill)

Stage 2: Ore Processing (Smelting, Refining)
- Input: Raw ore (variable quality)
- Process: Processing skill + facility
- Output: Ingot/refined material (quality retained: 80-100%)

Stage 3: Crafting

- Process: Weighted average of inputs × crafting skill
- Output: Final item (quality calculated from formula)

Quality Retention Formula:
Retention_Rate = Base_Rate × (Skill_Level / Required_Skill) × Facility_Quality

Where:
- Base_Rate: 0.80 (80% retention at exact skill)
- Skill_Level / Required_Skill: 0.5 to 1.5 range
- Facility_Quality: 0.9 to 1.1 range
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Realistic material flow
- Value addition at each stage

**Rationale:**
- Encourages community
- Mentorship creates bonds
- Accelerates new player learning
- Creates social content

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Mentorship system with benefits for both
- Shared research projects
- Guild knowledge repositories
- Tradeable maps and guides

### Lower Priority / Considerations

#### 9. Material Decay and Weathering
**Consideration:** Whether to implement material degradation over time

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Realism, prevents infinite stockpiling
- Con: Player frustration, inventory management burden
- Recommendation: Implement only for specific raw materials in specific contexts (e.g., wet clay drying out), not for processed materials

#### 10. Synthetic Materials
**Consideration:** Whether to allow player-created materials beyond natural processing

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Late-game content, creative possibilities
- Con: May break geological simulation focus
- Recommendation: Consider for post-launch expansion, keep initial focus on natural materials

#### 11. Material Rarity Balancing
**Consideration:** How to handle extremely rare materials

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Creates prestige items, exploration incentive
- Con: Potential for monopolization, accessibility issues
- Recommendation: Ensure rare materials are desirable but not essential for progression

BlueMarble should embrace Novus Inceptio's approach to material systems while learning from its weaknesses. Invest heavily in:
- **Exceptional UI/UX design** to make complexity accessible
- **Progressive tutorials** to ease learning curve
- **Clear progression paths** from novice to expert
- **Economic safeguards** to prevent market instability

The material and quality system is foundational to BlueMarble's identity. Getting it right will differentiate the game and create lasting engagement. Novus Inceptio proves that geological simulation can drive compelling gameplay - BlueMarble can refine and perfect this approach.
