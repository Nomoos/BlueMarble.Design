## Key Material System Patterns

### Quality Models
- **Discrete Tiers**: Common/Rare/Epic (traditional MMOs)
- **Continuous Scale**: 0-100% quality (LiF, Novus Inceptio)
- **Multi-Property**: 6+ properties per material (MO2)
- **Percentage-based**: 1-100% more realistic than discrete tiers

### Geological Integration
- **Formation Quality**: Geological context affects material properties
- **Geographic Specialization**: Regional material variations create trade
- **Extraction Method**: Tool quality and technique impact results
- **Processing Chain**: Quality flows through refinement stages

### Quality Inheritance
- **Material + Skill Weighting**: 60/40 or 50/50 split typical
- **Tool Quality Multipliers**: Better tools preserve quality
- **Workshop Bonuses**: Environment affects outcomes
- **Multi-stage Processing**: Each stage affects final quality

### Economic Integration
- **Quality-based Pricing**: Higher quality commands premium prices
- **Market Stratification**: Different tiers for different players
- **Specialization Value**: Master crafters achieve consistent quality
- **Material Sink**: Quality variation creates ongoing demand

## BlueMarble Applicability

### Perfect Alignment
- Geological simulation naturally provides material quality variance
- Mineral properties map directly to game statistics
- Formation type determines extraction difficulty and quality
- Geographic distribution creates realistic trade networks

### Recommended Approach
1. **Multi-property System**: Match geological material characteristics
2. **Continuous Quality Scale**: 0-100% more realistic than tiers
3. **Geological Source Impact**: Formation quality affects material
4. **Processing Chain Quality**: Quality flows through refinement
5. **Knowledge-based Discovery**: Experimentation unlocks materials
6. **Geographic Specialization**: Regional materials drive trade

### Adaptations Needed
- Avoid full loot PvP material loss
- Progressive complexity for new players
- Better UI/UX than hardcore survival games
- Educational value from geological properties

## Key Insights

### Most Applicable Reference
**Novus Inceptio** - Direct geological simulation focus makes it the most relevant reference for BlueMarble's material system design.

### Best Property Model
**Mortal Online 2** - Multi-property continuous scales provide depth without artificial tiers.

### Best Quality Inheritance
**Life is Feudal** - Clear material/skill weighting with tool multipliers provides transparent, predictable outcomes.
