# Step 2.1: Skill Systems

## Overview

Comprehensive research on skill progression systems from leading MMORPGs, focusing on specialization mechanics, knowledge systems, and progression pathways applicable to geological simulation gameplay.

## Research Content

### Core Skill System Research
- [Skill and Knowledge System Research](skill-knowledge-system-research.md) - Comprehensive MMORPG skill system analysis with BlueMarble recommendations
- [Realistic Basic Skills Research](realistic-basic-skills-research.md) - Fifteen core skills with 1024-level progression system
- [Assembly Skills System Research](assembly-skills-system-research.md) - Gathering and crafting skill integration
- [Player Stats and Attribute Systems Research](player-stats-attribute-systems-research.md) - Character attribute frameworks
- [Character Needs and Security Systems Research](character-needs-security-systems-research.md) - Hunger/thirst/fatigue, routine interruption, player guard hiring, and anti-exploitation systems

### Advanced Mechanics

- [Life is Feudal Skill Specialization Research](life-is-feudal-skill-specialization-system-research.md) - Hard skill cap and mastery systems
- [Vintage Story Skill and Knowledge Research](vintage-story-skill-knowledge-system-research.md) - Implicit progression through understanding
- [World of Warcraft Skill/Talent System Research](world-of-warcraft-skill-talent-system-research.md) - Class-based progression
- [Wurm Online Skill Progression Analysis](wurm-online-skill-progression-analysis.md) - Use-based skill grinding

## Key Findings

### Progression Models
- **Use-based**: Skills improve through practice (Wurm, LiF)
- **Experience-based**: Generic XP allocated to skills (traditional MMOs)
- **Knowledge-based**: Understanding unlocks capabilities (Vintage Story)
- **Hybrid**: Combination of multiple approaches (recommended for BlueMarble)

### Specialization Mechanics
- **Hard Skill Caps**: 600-point limits forcing specialization (LiF)
- **Skill Decay**: Use-it-or-lose-it mechanics for maintenance
- **Parent-Child Bonuses**: Related skills provide synergies
- **Technology Gates**: Knowledge requirements for advanced systems

### Knowledge Systems
- Discovery mechanics driving exploration
- Skill books and teaching economy (Eco)
- Handbook systems as learning tools (Vintage Story)
- Guild knowledge sharing and collaboration

## BlueMarble Recommendations

1. **Hybrid Progression**: Combine use-based practice with knowledge discovery
2. **Geological Specialization**: Skills tied to geological knowledge domains
3. **Tier System**: Clear progression milestones (Novice → Journeyman → Expert → Master)
4. **Parent-Child Bonuses**: Encourage coherent skill tree development
5. **Knowledge Discovery**: Geological understanding unlocks capabilities
6. **Optional Skill Caps**: Server-type dependent specialization requirements
