**Document Type:** Market Research Report  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** BlueMarble Game Design Research Team  
**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Status:** Research Report  
**Research Type:** Market Research  
**Priority:** Low

## Executive Summary

This research document analyzes Eco Global Survival's skill system and knowledge progression mechanics, focusing on collaborative specialization, crafting integration, and ecological impact. Eco's skill system is fundamentally different from traditional MMORPGs: it enforces mandatory collaboration through skill point scarcity, integrates environmental consequences with skill application, and uses knowledge sharing as a core progression mechanic.

**Key Findings:**
- **Forced Specialization:** Limited skill points (typically enough for 1-3 professions) create economic interdependence
- **Star-Based Progression:** Players earn skill points through productive activities, not combat
- **Skill Book System:** Knowledge transfer through craftable skill books enables teaching economy
- **Technology Gates:** Advanced professions require collaborative research and infrastructure
- **Environmental Integration:** Skill application has direct ecological consequences
- **Government Systems:** Players can legislate skill-related regulations and restrictions
- **No Traditional Levels:** Progression based on specialization depth, not character levels
- **Collaborative Research:** Technology unlocks require community resource investment

**Relevance to BlueMarble:**
Eco's collaborative skill system provides an excellent model for BlueMarble's geological simulation. The emphasis on specialization, knowledge discovery, and environmental consequences aligns perfectly with BlueMarble's educational mission and scientific foundation.

## Eco Game Overview

### Game Premise

Eco Global Survival is a multiplayer voxel-based civilization-building game where players must collaborate to build a technological society while preventing environmental collapse. A meteor threatens to destroy the world in 30 real-world days (configurable), creating urgency to advance technology while maintaining ecological balance.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
```
Resource Gathering → Processing → Crafting → Building Infrastructure
         ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓
   Environmental      Pollution    Collaboration  Technological
      Impact         Generation     Required      Advancement
         ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓
   Ecosystem         Remediation    Specialization  Meteor
   Management        Needed         Economy        Defense
```

### Design Philosophy

**Mandatory Collaboration:**
- No single player can master all professions
- Complex items require materials from multiple specialists
- Infrastructure projects need diverse skill sets

**Environmental Consequences:**
- Every action impacts the ecosystem
- Over-extraction causes species extinction
- Pollution affects player health and productivity
- Climate change threatens civilization survival

**Educational Value:**
- Teaches real ecology and economics
- Players learn cause-and-effect relationships
- Scientific accuracy in environmental simulation
- Government systems teach civics and policy

## Skill System Architecture

### Star-Based Skill Point System

Unlike traditional XP-based leveling, Eco uses a **star-based skill point system**:

**Point Earning Mechanics:**
```
Activity-Based Earning:
├─ Gathering Resources: 0.1-0.5 stars per action
├─ Crafting Items: 0.5-2.0 stars per craft
├─ Building Structures: 1.0-5.0 stars per building
├─ Teaching Others: 1.0-3.0 stars per skill book read by others
└─ Research Contribution: 2.0-10.0 stars per research completed

Time-Based Earning:
├─ Housing Quality: 0-10 stars per day (based on room quality)
├─ Food Variety: 0-5 stars per day (based on diet diversity)
└─ Collaboration Bonus: 0-5 stars per day (proximity to other players)
```

**Star Accumulation:**
- Stars accumulate in player's skill point pool
- 1 star = 1 skill point to spend on professions
- No level cap—points earned continuously
- Server configurable rates and multipliers

**Key Design Insight:**
Stars reward productive activity and quality of life improvements rather than combat or grinding. This encourages building, crafting, and social cooperation.

### Skill Point Allocation

**Total Point Budget:**
```
Typical Server Settings:
├─ Early Game (Day 1-10): ~20-50 total skill points
├─ Mid Game (Day 11-20): ~50-120 total skill points
├─ Late Game (Day 21-30): ~120-200 total skill points
└─ Post-Meteor: Unlimited progression

Point Requirements per Profession:
├─ Basic Profession: 20-30 points to unlock and become proficient
├─ Advanced Profession: 40-60 points to master
├─ Specialty Unlocks: 5-15 points per specialty within profession
└─ Full Mastery: 80-100 points for complete profession tree
```

**Specialization Pressure:**
```
With ~100-150 points available during meteor timeline:
├─ 1 Profession Fully Mastered: 80-100 points → 0-70 remaining
├─ 2 Professions Fully Mastered: 160-200 points → IMPOSSIBLE
├─ 3 Professions Partial: ~40-50 points each → Possible but limited
└─ Jack-of-All-Trades: ~15-20 points across 7-10 professions → Low efficiency

Result: Players must specialize to be effective
```

### Skill Book System

**Knowledge Transfer Mechanism:**

**Skill Books as Profession Unlocks:**
- Skill books are **crafted items** that unlock professions
- Each profession requires a specific skill book to begin
- Skill books can be traded, sold, or given to other players
- Advanced professions require prerequisite skill books

**Creating Skill Books:**
```
Requirements to Author Skill Books:
├─ Master Level in Target Profession (80+ points invested)
├─ Paper (crafted from wood pulp)
├─ Writing Desk or similar workspace
└─ Time investment (5-30 minutes crafting time)

Book Properties:
├─ Can be used unlimited times (doesn't consume)
├─ Tradeable and sellable
├─ Can be placed in libraries for public access
└─ Teacher receives stars when others use their books
```

**Learning from Skill Books:**
- Reading a skill book unlocks the profession in skill tree
- Does not grant skill points—player must still invest points
- Some books have prerequisites (must know X before learning Y)
- Creates teacher-student economic relationships

### No Traditional Character Levels

**Key Distinction from Standard MMORPGs:**
```
Traditional MMORPG:
Character Level 1 → Level 50 → Level 100
    ↓               ↓              ↓
Skills unlock   More skills    Max skills
at levels      become available available

Eco System:
Stars Earned Continuously → Allocate to Professions → Specialize Deeply
         ↓                           ↓                        ↓
   No level gates             Point scarcity           Master 1-3 areas
```

**Implications:**
- No "max level" milestone—progression is continuous
- Early specialization possible and encouraged
- Veterans and new players participate in same economy
- Skill tree depth matters more than character age

Total Stars Required:
Minimum Competent: 5☆ (unlock only)
Basic Smith: 30☆ (basic + one branch)
Advanced Smith: 60☆ (multiple branches)
Master Smith: 90☆ (all branches)
Complete Mastery: 105☆ (everything + specialties)

Prerequisites:
- Smelting skill book (must know metal processing)
- Access to forge (infrastructure)
- Iron or steel bars (materials)

Unlocks:
- Ability to craft metal tools and weapons
- Repair services for other players
- Teaching: Can create Smithing skill books at 80☆
```

### Specialization Paths

**Economic Roles from Specialization:**
- **Resource Extractors:** Focus on gathering professions, supply raw materials
- **Processors:** Master milling/smelting, convert resources to materials
- **Craftspeople:** Specialize in specific crafting, create finished goods
- **Engineers:** Build infrastructure, enable advanced technology
- **Researchers:** Contribute to technology advancement
- **Traders:** Facilitate exchange between specialists

## Collaboration Mechanics

### Forced Economic Interdependence

**Skill Point Scarcity Creates Trade:**
```
Player A (Miner/Smelter - 100☆):
├─ Extracts ore efficiently
├─ Processes into metal bars
└─ CANNOT make tools (no smithing points)

Player B (Smith - 80☆):
├─ Creates excellent tools
└─ NEEDS metal bars (no mining/smelting)

Result: Player A and B MUST trade
- A provides bars to B
- B provides tools to A
- Economic relationship formed
```

### Collaborative Projects

**Large-Scale Construction Requirements:**
```
Building: Industrial Factory

Materials Required:
├─ Stone Blocks: 1000 (Masonry)
├─ Steel Beams: 500 (Smelting + Smithing)
├─ Wooden Frames: 800 (Logging + Carpentry)
├─ Concrete: 600 (Engineering)
├─ Electrical Wiring: 200 (Electronics)
└─ Mechanical Components: 150 (Mechanics)

Minimum Specialists Needed: 6-8 players
Time Investment: 50-200 player-hours
Resource Cost: Massive material gathering

Single Player: Nearly impossible
Community: Achievable through cooperation
```

### Government Integration

**Skill-Based Legislation:**
```
Example Laws Players Can Enact:
├─ Logging Quotas: Max trees cut per day
├─ Mining Permits: Require license to mine
├─ Pollution Limits: Max emissions per building
├─ Professional Licensing: Require certification
├─ Trade Regulations: Tax rates on exchanges
└─ Education Requirements: Must learn before doing

Enforcement: Automatic by game systems
Violation: Activities blocked or fined
```

## Crafting Integration

### Skill Impact on Crafting

**Quality Calculation:**
```csharp
public float CalculateCraftQuality(Player crafter, Recipe recipe)
{
    float skillLevel = crafter.GetSkillLevel(recipe.Profession);
    float toolQuality = crafter.GetActiveToolQuality();
    float infrastructureBonus = crafter.GetWorkspaceQuality();
    
    // Base efficiency from skill
    float baseEfficiency = Mathf.Clamp(skillLevel / recipe.DifficultyRating, 0.5f, 1.5f);
    
    // Tool multiplier
    float toolMultiplier = 0.8f + (toolQuality * 0.4f);
    
    // Workspace bonus
    float workspaceBonus = 1.0f + (infrastructureBonus * 0.3f);
    
    return baseEfficiency * toolMultiplier * workspaceBonus;
}
```

**Skill Benefits in Crafting:**
- **Speed:** Higher skill = faster crafting time
- **Efficiency:** Less material waste at higher skill
- **Quality:** Better tools/items produced
- **Unlocks:** New recipes at skill thresholds
