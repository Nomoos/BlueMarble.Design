## Executive Summary

This research document designs comprehensive character needs systems (hunger, thirst, fatigue) and security 
mechanics for BlueMarble's routine-based gameplay. Drawing inspiration from Rust and other sandbox games, 
this system enables players to hire other players as guards while maintaining authenticity through character 
needs that dynamically interrupt routines. The design balances maximum player freedom with robust 
anti-exploitation systems for mining, building, terraforming, and trade.

**Key Design Goals:**
- Character needs (hunger, thirst, fatigue) authentically affect routine execution
- Dynamic routine interruption based on critical needs states
- Player-to-player guard hiring and security routines
- Guards affected by their own needs (may fall asleep, need food/water)
- Anti-exploitation systems for sandbox mechanics
- Balance between player freedom and protection from abuse

**Core Innovations:**
- Needs-based routine priority system with emergency overrides
- Intelligent routine switching when character reaches critical states
- Player guard contracts with performance affected by guard's own needs
- Progressive security systems scaling from simple to complex
- Economic balance through resource costs for exploitation prevention
- Geological constraints integrated with sandbox freedom mechanics

## Character Needs System

### Core Needs Framework

**Three Primary Needs:**

```
Hunger (Food)
├── Range: 0-100%
├── Decay Rate: -2% per hour (base)
├── Critical Threshold: <15%
└── Emergency Threshold: <5%

Thirst (Water)
├── Range: 0-100%
├── Decay Rate: -3% per hour (base)
├── Critical Threshold: <20%
└── Emergency Threshold: <10%

Fatigue (Rest/Sleep)
├── Range: 0-100%
├── Decay Rate: -4% per hour (base)
├── Critical Threshold: <25%
└── Emergency Threshold: <15%
```

**Decay Rate Modifiers:**

```yaml
Activity Multipliers:
  Idle/Resting: 0.5x base decay
  Light Work (crafting, gathering): 1.0x base decay
  Medium Work (mining, building): 1.5x base decay
  Heavy Work (deep mining, terraforming): 2.0x base decay
  Combat/Security: 1.8x base decay

Environmental Multipliers:
  Comfortable Temperature: 1.0x
  Cold Climate: 1.3x (increased hunger, faster fatigue)
  Hot Climate: 1.4x (increased thirst, faster fatigue)
  Altitude (>2000m): 1.2x (all needs)
  
Skill Efficiency Modifiers:
  Survival Skill < 100: 1.0x
  Survival Skill 100-500: 0.9x
  Survival Skill 500-800: 0.8x
  Survival Skill 800-1024: 0.7x
```

### Needs Impact on Performance

**Performance Degradation Table:**

| Need Level | Performance | Effects on Routines | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| 100-75% | Optimal | No penalties | Healthy |
| 75-50% | Good | -5% skill check success | Comfortable |
| 50-30% | Reduced | -15% skill check, -10% speed | Hungry/Tired |
| 30-15% | Poor | -30% skill check, -25% speed | Very Hungry/Tired |
| 15-5% | Critical | -50% skill check, -40% speed, warnings | Critical |
| <5% | Emergency | Routine auto-interrupted, forced need satisfaction | Emergency |

**Code Example:**

        # Apply decay
        base_hunger_decay = 2.0
        base_thirst_decay = 3.0
        base_fatigue_decay = 4.0
        
        total_mult = activity_mult * env_mult * skill_mult
        
        self.hunger -= base_hunger_decay * total_mult * time_elapsed_hours

        min_need = min(self.hunger, self.thirst, self.fatigue)
        
        if min_need >= 75:
            return 0.0
        elif min_need >= 50:

    def is_critical(self):
        """Check if any need is in critical state"""
        return (self.hunger < 15 or

## Routine Interruption Mechanics

### Priority System

**Routine Priority Hierarchy:**

```python
class RoutinePriority:
    EMERGENCY_NEEDS = 1      # Critical hunger/thirst/fatigue
    COMBAT_DEFENSE = 2       # Under attack
    CRITICAL_NEEDS = 3       # Needs below critical threshold
    PLAYER_OVERRIDE = 4      # Player manually changes routine
    SCHEDULED_ROUTINE = 5    # Normal routine execution
    BACKGROUND_TASKS = 6     # Low priority maintenance
```

### Automatic Routine Switching

**Needs-Based Interruption Logic:**

```python
class RoutineManager:
    def check_interruption_conditions(self, character, current_routine):
        """Check if routine should be interrupted"""
        needs = character.needs
        
        # Emergency state - immediate interruption
        if needs.is_emergency():
            critical_need = needs.get_most_critical_need()
            return self.create_emergency_routine(critical_need)
        
        # Critical state - interrupt after current block
        if needs.is_critical():
            critical_need = needs.get_most_critical_need()
            return self.queue_critical_need_routine(critical_need)
        
        # No interruption needed
        return None
    
    def create_emergency_routine(self, need_type):
        """Create emergency routine to satisfy critical need"""
        if need_type == 'thirst':
            return EmergencyRoutine(
                action='find_and_drink_water',
                priority=RoutinePriority.EMERGENCY_NEEDS,
                interrupt_current=True,
                description='Character is desperately thirsty - seeking water immediately'
            )
        elif need_type == 'hunger':
            return EmergencyRoutine(
                action='find_and_eat_food',
                priority=RoutinePriority.EMERGENCY_NEEDS,
                interrupt_current=True,
                description='Character is starving - seeking food immediately'
            )
        elif need_type == 'fatigue':
            return EmergencyRoutine(
                action='emergency_rest',
                priority=RoutinePriority.EMERGENCY_NEEDS,
                interrupt_current=True,
                description='Character is exhausted - must rest immediately'
            )
    
    def queue_critical_need_routine(self, need_type):
        """Queue routine to satisfy need after current block"""
        routine = self.create_need_satisfaction_routine(need_type)
        routine.priority = RoutinePriority.CRITICAL_NEEDS
        routine.interrupt_current = False  # Wait for current block
        return routine
```

**Emergency Behavior Examples:**

```yaml
Emergency Thirst (< 10%):
  Behavior:
    - Immediately interrupt current action
    - Search for nearest water source within 500m
    - If no water found, alert player
    - Drink until thirst > 40%
    - Resume previous routine
  
  Fallback Options:
    - Use water from inventory if available
    - Ask nearby players for water (trade system)
    - Travel to known water source (mapped locations)
  
  Player Notification:
    "Your character is critically thirsty and has stopped working to find water."

Emergency Hunger (< 5%):
  Behavior:
    - Interrupt current action after safety check
    - Search inventory for any edible food
    - If no food, search nearby buildings/storage
    - Eat until hunger > 30%
    - Resume previous routine
  
  Fallback Options:
    - Gather basic foods (berries, roots) if available
    - Hunt small game if hunting skill permits
    - Buy food from nearby market/players
  
  Player Notification:
    "Your character is starving and has stopped to find food."

Emergency Fatigue (< 15%):
  Behavior:
    - Complete current block if safe
    - Find safest nearby rest location
    - If in danger zone, travel to safety first
    - Rest for minimum 4 hours or until fatigue > 50%
    - Resume previous routine
  
  Risk:
    - May fall asleep in unsafe location if fatigue < 5%
    - Vulnerability during rest period
  
  Player Notification:
    "Your character is exhausted and must rest immediately."
```

### Guard Routine Special Cases

**Guard on Duty with Critical Needs:**

```python
class GuardRoutine:
    def __init__(self, guard_character, contract):
        self.guard = guard_character
        self.contract = contract
        self.post_location = contract.guard_post
        self.patrol_route = contract.patrol_route
        
    def execute(self, time_elapsed):
        """Execute guard routine with needs consideration"""
        needs = self.guard.needs
        
        # Check if guard can continue
        if needs.fatigue < 15:
            # Guard falls asleep on duty
            self.guard_falls_asleep()
            self.notify_employer("Guard has fallen asleep on duty due to exhaustion")
            return GuardStatus.ASLEEP
        
        elif needs.fatigue < 30:
            # Guard is drowsy - reduced effectiveness
            self.guard.alertness *= 0.5
            self.notify_employer("Guard is very tired - reduced alertness")
            
        if needs.thirst < 10:
            # Must drink immediately
            self.temporary_break('drink_water', duration_minutes=5)
            self.notify_employer("Guard taking water break")
            return GuardStatus.ON_BREAK
            
        if needs.hunger < 5:
            # Must eat immediately
            self.temporary_break('eat_food', duration_minutes=15)
            self.notify_employer("Guard taking meal break")
            return GuardStatus.ON_BREAK
        
        # Normal guard execution
        return self.perform_guard_duties()
    
    def guard_falls_asleep(self):
        """Handle guard falling asleep on post"""
        self.guard.status = CharacterStatus.SLEEPING
        self.guard.vulnerability = 'high'
        self.contract.breach_penalty = True
        
        # Guard sleeps until fatigue > 50% or disturbed
        sleep_duration = self.calculate_recovery_sleep_time()
        self.schedule_wake_up(sleep_duration)
```

**Intelligent Need Management for Guards:**

```yaml
Guard Shift Management:
  Smart Guards (High Intelligence/Survival):
    - Monitor own needs proactively
    - Take breaks before critical thresholds
    - Request relief when needs reach 40%
    - Carry food/water for shift
    - Plan rest periods during low-activity times
  
  Basic Guards (Low Skills):
    - React only when needs critical
    - May fall asleep unexpectedly
    - Less reliable long-term
    - Require more supervision
  
  Professional Guards (Skilled):
    - Optimal need management
    - Coordinate shifts with other guards
    - Minimal downtime
    - Proactive communication
    
Contract Terms Should Include:
  - Shift duration (4, 8, or 12 hours)
  - Break allowances (meals, water, rest)
  - Performance penalties for falling asleep
  - Food/water provision requirements
  - Relief schedule coordination
```

## Security and Guard Systems

### Player-to-Player Guard Contracts

```python
class GuardContract:
    def __init__(self):
        self.employer = None        # Player hiring guard
        self.guard = None          # Player being hired
        self.duration_hours = 0    # Contract length
        self.payment = 0           # Payment in currency
        self.location = None       # Guard post location
        self.responsibilities = []  # What guard protects
        self.break_allowances = {}  # Scheduled breaks
        self.penalty_clauses = {}   # Breach penalties
        
    def create_contract(self, employer, guard, terms):
        """Create new guard contract"""
        self.employer = employer
        self.guard = guard
        self.duration_hours = terms['duration']
        self.payment = terms['payment']
        self.location = terms['location']
        
        # Responsibilities
        self.responsibilities = terms.get('responsibilities', [
            'patrol_area',
            'alert_on_intruders',
            'defend_property',
            'report_suspicious_activity'
        ])
        
        # Break allowances
        self.break_allowances = terms.get('breaks', {
            'meals': 2,              # Number of meal breaks
            'meal_duration': 15,     # Minutes per meal
            'water_breaks': 4,       # Number of water breaks
            'water_duration': 5,     # Minutes per water break
            'rest_allowed': False    # Can guard rest during shift?
        })
        
        # Penalty clauses
        self.penalty_clauses = terms.get('penalties', {
            'falls_asleep': -50,     # Penalty for falling asleep (% of payment)
            'abandons_post': -100,   # Penalty for leaving
            'fails_alert': -25,      # Missed intruder alert
            'successful_defense': +25 # Bonus for stopping intruder

class MiningExploitationDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hourly_extraction_limits = {
            'basic_tools': 100,      # kg per hour

        }
        
    def check_mining_activity(self, player, timeframe_hours=1):
        """Monitor mining activity for exploitation patterns"""
        extracted_volume = player.get_extracted_volume(timeframe_hours)
        tool_tier = player.get_current_tool_tier()

## Conclusion

This character needs and security systems research provides a comprehensive framework for implementing:

1. **Authentic Character Needs**: Hunger, thirst, and fatigue systems that integrate seamlessly with 
BlueMarble's routine-based gameplay, adding depth without tedium.

2. **Dynamic Routine Interruption**: Intelligent systems that override routines when character needs become 
critical, creating authentic behavior while maintaining player agency.

3. **Player Guard Services**: Comprehensive contract system enabling players to hire other players as guards, 
with realistic performance affected by the guard's own needs and skills.

4. **Anti-Exploitation Systems**: Multi-layered protection against exploitation of sandbox mechanics, 
balancing freedom with game health through geological constraints, resource costs, and time requirements.

5. **Progressive Freedom Model**: Three-tier system that provides immediate sandbox freedom while gating 
powerful capabilities behind skill progression and social coordination.

The design maintains BlueMarble's core values of geological authenticity, player freedom, and strategic depth 
while preventing exploitation and ensuring long-term game balance. Implementation can proceed in phases, 
allowing for iterative testing and refinement based on player feedback.

**Next Steps:**
- Prototype needs decay system
- Test routine interruption logic
- Design guard contract UI
- Implement basic anti-exploitation monitoring
- Gather player feedback through alpha testing
