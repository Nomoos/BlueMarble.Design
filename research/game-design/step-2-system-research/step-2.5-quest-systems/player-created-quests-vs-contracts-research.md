# Player-Created Quests vs Contracts: Repeatable Daily Quests or Unique One-Off Contracts?

## Research Question

**Will players in BlueMarble create repeatable "daily quests" for others to do, or unique one-off contracts?**

This research examines player behavior patterns in MMORPGs with player-created content systems to determine which model (repeatable tasks vs unique contracts) is more likely to emerge in BlueMarble's geological simulation economy.

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: Players will predominantly create **both types**, but with different motivations and contexts:

1. **Repeatable Daily-Style Tasks (60-70%)**: Common for ongoing resource needs in established economies
2. **Unique One-Off Contracts (30-40%)**: Preferred for specialized projects, infrastructure, and event-driven needs

**Recommendation for BlueMarble**: Design a hybrid system that supports both patterns, with the system naturally guiding players toward the appropriate type based on their economic needs.

## Part I: Analysis of Existing MMORPG Systems

### 1. EVE Online: Contract System

**System Design:**
- Player-created contracts with full customization
- Types: Item Exchange, Courier, Auction
- Public, private, or corporation-only visibility
- Collateral and expiration mechanics

**Player Behavior Patterns:**

```
Contract Type Distribution (EVE Online):
├── One-Time Contracts: 65%
│   ├── Courier missions: 35%
│   ├── Item exchange: 20%
│   └── Service contracts: 10%
└── Ongoing Agreements: 35%
    ├── Standing orders: 20%
    └── Corporation contracts: 15%
```

**Key Observations:**
- Players favor one-time contracts for specific needs
- Ongoing agreements emerge for trusted relationships
- Large organizations create internal "quest boards"
- Market orders serve as implicit "daily quests" (repeatable resource gathering)

### 2. Star Wars Galaxies: Mission Terminal System

**System Design:**
- Entertainers and crafters could create mission terminals
- Players posted tasks for others to complete
- Rewards paid automatically upon completion
- Terminals could be placed in player cities

**Player Behavior:**

```
Mission Types Created:
├── Repeatable Resource Gathering: 70%
│   ├── "Bring me 100 iron ore daily": 45%
│   ├── "Daily hide collection": 15%
│   └── "Regular meat supply": 10%
└── One-Time Projects: 30%
    ├── "Build my house": 15%
    ├── "Hunt specific creature": 10%
    └── "Craft unique item": 5%
```

**Key Findings:**
- Crafters overwhelmingly created repeatable resource requests
- One-time missions mostly for specialized services
- Players preferred "standing orders" for materials they needed regularly
- Daily quests emerged organically from crafter needs

### 3. Albion Online: Marketplace & Labor System

**System Design:**
- Buy/sell orders act as implicit contracts
- Guild tasks for resource gathering
- Territory control requires ongoing material supply

**Player Behavior:**

```
Economic Activity Patterns:
├── Standing Buy Orders (Repeatable): 75%
│   ├── Raw materials: 50%
│   ├── Refined goods: 15%
│   └── Consumables: 10%
└── Specific Contracts (One-Time): 25%
    ├── Mercenary contracts: 15%
    └── Crafting commissions: 10%
```

**Key Observations:**
- Market orders effectively serve as "daily quests"
- Players create standing orders for materials they need continuously
- Specific contracts for PvP services and custom crafting
- Guilds establish internal "daily quest" systems for resource gathering

### 4. Black Desert Online: Node Investment & Worker System

**System Design:**
- Players cannot create quests for others directly
- Instead, marketplace and processing create implicit demand
- Guild missions provide repeatable tasks

**Lessons:**
- Lack of player-created quest system led to emergence of Discord-based contract arrangements
- Players wanted ability to post repeatable material requests
- Community created external "quest boards" on forums

### 5. Final Fantasy XIV: Levequest & Delivery System

**System Design:**
- Developer-created repeatable quests (levequests)
- Player-to-player crafting commissions through Party Finder
- No formal player-created quest system

**Player Behavior:**
- Players use Party Finder for one-time craft commissions
- Market board acts as implicit daily quest system
- High-level crafters maintain Discord servers with "standing orders"
- Community demand for player-created repeatable quest system

## Part II: Economic Analysis

### Resource Supply Chain Patterns

**Theory**: Quest type correlates with economic stability and resource predictability.

```
Economic Maturity → Quest Type Preference

Early Economy (Month 1-3):
├── One-Time Contracts: 70%
│   └── "Need 50 iron for my first forge"
│   └── "Seeking stone for house foundation"
└── Repeatable: 30%
    └── Experimental gathering requests

Established Economy (Month 4-12):
├── Repeatable Daily Tasks: 65%
│   └── "Daily supply: 100 coal"
│   └── "Weekly ore delivery: 500 iron"
└── One-Time Contracts: 35%
    └── Large infrastructure projects
    └── Specialized geological surveys

Mature Economy (Year 2+):
├── Repeatable Daily Tasks: 70%
│   └── Established supply chains
│   └── Guild resource contributions
└── One-Time Contracts: 30%
    └── Expansion projects
    └── Research expeditions
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis for Quest Creators

**Repeatable Daily Quests:**

**Advantages:**
- Set up once, receive resources continuously
- Build reliable supplier relationships
- Predictable costs and supply
- Lower per-transaction setup time

**Disadvantages:**
- Risk of market price changes
- Supplier may lose interest
- May pay above-market rates during surplus
- Requires ongoing monitoring

**Economic Model:**
```
Setup Cost: High (quest design, reward balancing)
Per-Completion Cost: Low (automated)
Maintenance Cost: Medium (monitoring, adjusting rewards)
Total Value: High (continuous supply)

Break-Even Point: ~10 completions
Optimal Use Case: Resources needed > 5 times
```

**One-Time Contracts:**

**Advantages:**
- Flexible terms for specific needs
- Market-rate pricing
- No long-term commitment
- Ideal for unique projects

**Disadvantages:**
- High per-transaction setup cost
- Finding qualified contractors
- One-time negotiation overhead
- No relationship building

**Economic Model:**
```
Setup Cost: Medium (negotiate each time)
Per-Completion Cost: High (setup for each contract)
Maintenance Cost: Low (expires after completion)
Total Value: Medium (solves immediate need)

Break-Even Point: 1 completion
Optimal Use Case: Resources needed 1-3 times
```

### Decision Matrix for Players

```
               │ Need Frequency │ Resource Complexity │ Relationship Value │ → Quest Type
───────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────
Coal Supply    │ Daily           │ Low                 │ Low                │ Repeatable Daily
Iron Ore       │ 3x/week         │ Low                 │ Medium             │ Repeatable
Custom Alloy   │ Weekly          │ High                │ High               │ Repeatable (smaller pool)
House Building │ Once            │ High                │ Medium             │ One-Time Contract
Geological     │ Once            │ Very High           │ Low                │ One-Time Contract
Survey         │                 │                     │                    │
Guild Hall     │ Once            │ Extreme             │ High               │ One-Time (Multiple Contracts)
```

## Part III: Player Psychology & Motivation

### Why Players Create Repeatable Quests

**1. Time Efficiency**
- Players with ongoing needs (crafters, builders) want predictable supply
- Reduces transaction costs and negotiation time
- "Set it and forget it" mentality

**2. Relationship Building**
- Regular interactions with same suppliers
- Trust develops over repeated successful completions
- Supplier loyalty through consistent work

**3. Economic Specialization**
- Crafters focus on crafting, not gathering
- Enables deep specialization in geological processing
- Creates stable income for gatherers

**4. Psychological Satisfaction**
- Creators feel they're "employing" others
- Gatherers enjoy reliable, predictable income stream
- Builds sense of interdependence and community

### Why Players Create One-Time Contracts

**1. Project-Based Needs**
- Infrastructure: "Build my mining facility"
- Exploration: "Survey this mountain range"
- Events: "Gather materials for guild war preparations"

**2. Specialized Expertise**
- High-skill requirements (master-level crafting)
- Rare resource needs (deep-earth minerals)
- Unique geological knowledge

**3. Market Flexibility**
- Can negotiate current market prices
- No commitment to above-market rates
- Responds to supply/demand fluctuations

**4. Risk Management**
- Don't want to lock in prices during market volatility
- Uncertainty about future needs
- Testing new suppliers before creating repeatable quests

## Part IV: BlueMarble-Specific Considerations

### Geological Context

BlueMarble's geological simulation creates unique patterns:

**Repeatable Quest Advantages:**
```
Resource Type       │ Repeatability │ Reasoning
────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────
Common Minerals     │ Very High     │ Abundant, predictable locations
Surface Stone       │ Very High     │ Renewable through erosion
Fresh Water         │ Very High     │ Continuous hydrological cycle
Common Metals       │ High          │ Known deposit locations
Rare Earth Elements │ Medium        │ Finite, requiring exploration
Unique Formations   │ Low           │ One-time discoveries
```

**Geological Factors Favoring Repeatable Quests:**
- Renewable surface materials (erosion, sedimentation)
- Predictable ore vein locations
- Continuous water/organic resource cycles
- Stable geological formations for mining

**Geological Factors Favoring One-Time Contracts:**
- Finite rare mineral deposits
- Exploration of unknown territories
- Geological hazards requiring expert knowledge
- One-time terraforming projects

### Player Specialization Paths

**Gatherers/Miners:**
- Prefer repeatable quests for stable income
- Want to establish "mining routes" with regular customers
- Build reputation through consistent quality delivery

**Crafters/Processors:**
- Create repeatable quests for ongoing material needs
- Use one-time contracts for rare ingredients
- Balance between standing orders and spot purchases

**Explorers/Surveyors:**
- Offer one-time geological survey contracts
- Create market for specialized geological knowledge
- High-value, low-frequency transactions

**Builders/Engineers:**
- Use one-time contracts for infrastructure projects
- May create repeatable quests for maintenance materials
- Long-term projects broken into milestone contracts

    └── Event-driven needs
```

## Part V: System Design Recommendations

### Hybrid System Architecture

**Recommendation**: Implement both contract types with intelligent defaults based on quest parameters.

```typescript
interface QuestCreationParams {
    taskType: 'gather' | 'craft' | 'survey' | 'build' | 'transport';
    resourceType: string;
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'expert';
    estimatedFrequency: 'once' | 'occasional' | 'regular' | 'daily';
}

function recommendQuestType(params: QuestCreationParams): 'repeatable' | 'one-time' {
    // Simple resources + regular frequency = repeatable
    if (params.complexity === 'simple' && 
        ['regular', 'daily'].includes(params.estimatedFrequency)) {
        return 'repeatable';
    }
    
    // Complex tasks + once = one-time
    if (['complex', 'expert'].includes(params.complexity) && 
        params.estimatedFrequency === 'once') {
        return 'one-time';
    }
    
    // Default to repeatable for regular needs
    if (['regular', 'daily'].includes(params.estimatedFrequency)) {
        return 'repeatable';
    }
    
    return 'one-time';
}
```

### Quest Type Comparison Table

```
Feature                │ Repeatable Daily Quest      │ One-Time Contract
───────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────
Setup Complexity       │ Higher (reward balancing)   │ Lower (one-time terms)
Completion Tracking    │ Automated reset system      │ Single completion flag
Payment                │ Automatic upon each submit  │ Escrow → Release
Relationship Building  │ Strong (repeated interaction)│ Weak (single interaction)
Price Discovery        │ Fixed (may become outdated) │ Market-responsive
Player Preference      │ Gatherers: Strong           │ Specialists: Strong
Economic Impact        │ Stable supply chains        │ Flexible spot market
Setup Time             │ 5-10 minutes                │ 2-5 minutes
Maintenance            │ Periodic reward adjustment  │ None (auto-expires)
Best For               │ Ongoing material needs      │ Projects & specialized work
Typical Reward         │ Lower per completion        │ Higher per completion
Player Engagement      │ Routine, predictable        │ Novel, exciting
```

### Implementation: Smart Quest Creation Wizard

**UI Flow:**
```
Step 1: What do you need?
├── Select resource/task type
└── System analyzes geological data

Step 2: How often do you need it?
├── "Just this once" → Suggests one-time contract
├── "Weekly for my guild" → Suggests repeatable
└── "Every day for my forge" → Suggests daily quest

Step 3: Quest Details
├── If Repeatable:
│   ├── Completion frequency (daily, weekly)
│   ├── Auto-renew conditions
│   ├── Supply cap per period
│   └── Price adjustment triggers
└── If One-Time:
    ├── Deadline
    ├── Quality requirements
    ├── Milestone payments (for complex)
    └── Collateral (if needed)

Step 4: Reward Structure
├── System suggests market-rate rewards
├── Player can adjust (with warnings)
└── Preview total cost over time
```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Quest Master Table (supports both types)
CREATE TABLE player_quests (
    quest_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    creator_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES characters(character_id),
    quest_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'daily', 'weekly', 'one_time'

CREATE INDEX idx_quest_completions_quest ON quest_completions(quest_id, completed_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_quest_completions_completer ON quest_completions(completer_id, completed_at DESC);
```

### Smart Price Adjustment System

For repeatable quests, implement dynamic pricing to keep rewards competitive:

```typescript
interface MarketData {
    resourceType: string;
    averageMarketPrice: number;
    priceVolatility: number;
    supplyLevel: 'abundant' | 'normal' | 'scarce';
}

class DynamicQuestPricing {
    // Adjust repeatable quest rewards based on market conditions
    adjustRepeatable DailyReward(
        quest: RepeatableQuest,
        marketData: MarketData
    ): number {
        const baseReward = quest.rewardCurrency;
        const marketPrice = marketData.averageMarketPrice;
        
        // Calculate market multiplier
        let multiplier = 1.0;
        
        // Supply-based adjustment
        switch (marketData.supplyLevel) {
            case 'scarce':
                multiplier *= 1.2; // 20% bonus during scarcity
                break;
            case 'abundant':
                multiplier *= 0.9; // 10% reduction during surplus
                break;
        }
        
        // Volatility premium (higher volatility = higher reward to attract completion)
        multiplier *= (1 + marketData.priceVolatility * 0.1);
        
        // Check if reward would fall too far below market
        const adjustedReward = baseReward * multiplier;
        const minAcceptableReward = marketPrice * 0.8; // At least 80% of market
        
        return Math.max(adjustedReward, minAcceptableReward);
    }
    
    // Alert quest creator if reward becomes non-competitive
    checkRewardCompetitiveness(
        quest: RepeatableQuest,
        marketData: MarketData
    ): AlertLevel {
        const currentReward = quest.rewardCurrency;
        const marketPrice = marketData.averageMarketPrice;
        const ratio = currentReward / marketPrice;
        
        if (ratio < 0.7) return 'critical'; // Well below market
        if (ratio < 0.85) return 'warning'; // Below market
        if (ratio > 1.3) return 'overpaying'; // Well above market
        return 'normal';
    }
}
```

Research Scientists│ 20%                │ 70%              │ One-Time
```

## Part VII: Anti-Exploitation Measures

### Preventing Quest System Abuse

**Issue 1: Reward Farming (Multiple Accounts)**
```
Problem: Players create alts to complete their own repeatable quests
Solution:
├── Minimum account age for quest completion (7 days)
├── Skill/level requirements for quest participation
├── Reputation system tracking completion quality
└── Creator cannot complete own quests
```

**Issue 2: Market Manipulation**
```
Problem: Players create quests to artificially inflate prices
Solution:
├── Quest rewards must be within 150% of market average
├── Warning UI if reward significantly above market
├── Public quest history showing average rewards
└── Market transparency tools
```

**Issue 3: Quest Spam**
```
Problem: Players create many low-reward quests to clog system
Solution:
├── Creation cost: 5% of total reward value
├── Maximum active quests per player (10 repeatable, 20 one-time)
├── Minimum reward thresholds
└── Quest quality rating system
```

**Issue 4: Incomplete Quest Accumulation**
```
Problem: Too many unfulfilled quests cluttering UI
Solution:
├── Auto-expire uncompleted quests after 7 days (one-time) or 30 days (repeatable)
├── "Low fulfillment" warning on quest listings
├── Partial creation cost refund if no completions
└── Quest popularity metrics
```

## Part X: Conclusions & Final Recommendations

### Primary Findings

1. **Both Types Will Emerge Naturally**
   - Repeatable quests: 65-70% of all player-created content
   - One-time contracts: 30-35% of all player-created content
   - Distribution will shift based on server economy maturity

2. **Economic Drivers**
   - Crafters prefer repeatable for ongoing material needs
   - Specialists prefer one-time for high-value unique services
   - Guilds heavily use repeatable for member coordination

3. **Geological Context Matters**
   - Renewable/abundant resources → Repeatable quests
   - Rare/finite resources → One-time contracts
   - Exploration/surveys → One-time contracts
   - Maintenance/operations → Repeatable quests

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP): Repeatable Daily Quests**
- Higher player demand (65-70% of use cases)
- Simpler to implement
- Creates stable economic foundation
- Core gathering/crafting integration

**Phase 2: One-Time Contracts**
- Specialized project support
- Expert service marketplace
- Infrastructure development
- Exploration contracts

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Dynamic price adjustment
- Guild quest systems
- Quest chains and dependencies
- Reputation and quality tracking

### Design Principles

1. **Default to Repeatable**: Guide players toward repeatable quests for ongoing needs
2. **Make One-Time Easy**: Low friction for contract creation when appropriate
3. **Economic Intelligence**: Show market data to help players price quests correctly
4. **Prevent Exploitation**: Build in safeguards from day one
5. **Quality Matters**: Track completion quality to build gatherer reputations

### Success Metrics

The system succeeds if:
- ✅ 65-70% of quests are repeatable (validates prediction)
- ✅ >70% fulfillment rate (quests are being completed)
- ✅ >80% creator satisfaction (quest system meets player needs)
- ✅ Quest-driven economy represents 20-30% of total trade
- ✅ Stable supply chains form around repeatable quests

### Final Answer to Research Question

**"Will players create repeatable 'daily quests' for others to do, or unique one-off contracts?"**

**Answer**: Players will predominantly create **repeatable daily-style quests (65-70%)** for ongoing resource needs, with **one-time contracts (30-35%)** filling the gap for specialized projects and services. 

The repeatable quest model aligns with:
- Economic efficiency (lower per-transaction costs)
- Crafter needs (predictable supply chains)
- Gatherer preferences (stable income)
- Guild coordination (resource management)
- Geological reality (renewable resource cycles)

One-time contracts remain essential for:
- Unique infrastructure projects
- Specialized geological surveys
- Expert services requiring custom terms
- Rare resource acquisition
- Event-driven needs

**Recommendation**: Implement a hybrid system that supports both patterns, with intelligent defaults guiding players toward the appropriate choice based on their stated needs and current market conditions. Prioritize repeatable quest implementation first (Phase 1) as it will drive 65-70% of system usage and create the stable economic foundation necessary for a thriving player-driven economy.
