# Step 2.5: Quest and Contract Systems

## Overview

Research on player-created quest and contract systems in MMORPGs, focusing on understanding player behavior patterns around repeatable daily quests versus unique one-off contracts.

## Research Documents

### [Player-Created Quests vs Contracts Research](player-created-quests-vs-contracts-research.md)

Comprehensive analysis addressing the core research question: **"Will players create repeatable 'daily quests' for others to do, or unique one-off contracts?"**

**Key Findings:**
- Players will create **both types**, with repeatable quests dominating at 65-70%
- Economic efficiency drives preference for repeatable quests for ongoing needs
- One-time contracts fill specialized niche for projects and expert services
- Distribution varies by server economy maturity and geological context

**Contents:**
- Analysis of 5 major MMORPG quest/contract systems (EVE Online, SWG, Albion, BDO, FFXIV)
- Economic analysis and cost-benefit modeling
- Player psychology and motivation factors
- BlueMarble-specific geological considerations
- Detailed system design recommendations
- Database schema and implementation architecture
- UI/UX mockups and user flows
- Success metrics and KPIs

## Research Methodology

### Comparative Analysis
- Examined player-created content systems in leading MMORPGs
- Analyzed economic patterns and player behavior data
- Reviewed community feedback and forum discussions
- Applied findings to BlueMarble's geological simulation context

### Data Sources
- EVE Online: CSM meeting notes, dev blogs, player economy reports
- Star Wars Galaxies: Developer postmortems, player testimonials
- Albion Online: Market data, guild survey results
- Black Desert Online: Community forums, feature request history
- Final Fantasy XIV: Player Finder usage patterns, crafter surveys

## Key Recommendations for BlueMarble

### System Design
1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Support both repeatable and one-time contracts
2. **Intelligent Defaults**: Guide players toward appropriate quest type
3. **Market Integration**: Dynamic pricing based on geological material availability
4. **Quality Tracking**: Reputation system for gatherers and contractors

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Repeatable daily quests for resource gathering
2. **Phase 2**: One-time contracts for specialized projects
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (dynamic pricing, guild integration, quest chains)

### Success Criteria
- 65-70% repeatable quest usage (validates player preference prediction)
- >70% quest fulfillment rate (system meets player needs)
- 20-30% of economy flows through quest system
- High creator and completer satisfaction ratings

## Integration with BlueMarble Systems

### Geological Simulation
- Renewable resources (erosion, sedimentation) → Repeatable quests
- Finite rare minerals → One-time contracts
- Exploration and surveys → Specialized contracts
- Infrastructure maintenance → Repeatable tasks

### Player Specialization
- **Crafters**: Primary creators of repeatable resource quests
- **Gatherers**: Primary completers of repeatable quests
- **Explorers**: Create and complete one-time survey contracts
- **Builders**: Use one-time contracts for infrastructure projects
- **Guilds**: Heavy users of repeatable quests for coordination

### Economic Systems
- Quest rewards create price floors for materials
- Repeatable quests establish stable supply chains
- One-time contracts enable spot market flexibility
- Dynamic pricing prevents market manipulation

## Future Research Directions

### Potential Extensions
1. **Quest Chains**: Multi-stage contracts with dependencies
2. **Guild Quest Systems**: Coordinated resource gathering at scale
3. **Reputation Markets**: Specialized contractors with verified expertise
4. **Automated Quest Generation**: AI-driven contract suggestions based on market needs
5. **Cross-Server Contracts**: Enable inter-server resource trade

### Open Questions
- How to prevent quest system exploitation in early server economy?
- What's the optimal balance between automated and manual price adjustment?
- Should guilds have special quest creation privileges?
- How to integrate quest system with geological discovery mechanics?
