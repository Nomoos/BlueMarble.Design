## Guild System Structure

### Hierarchy
- **Master**: Guild member with business and apprentices
- **Journeyman**: Completed apprenticeship, works for wages
- **Apprentice**: 7-10 year training under master

### Guild Functions
- Quality control and standards enforcement
- Training and skill certification
- Economic regulation and pricing
- Social welfare for members
- Political representation

## Medieval Economic Context

### Population Distribution
- **Agriculture**: 70-90% of medieval population
- **Urban Crafts**: 10-20% in cities and towns
- **Elite Professions**: <5% (administration, military, clergy)

### Technological Milestones
- Water wheels and windmills (8th-12th century)
- Printing press (1440s) - massive job creation
- Navigation instruments (15th-16th century)
- Proto-industrial machinery (17th-18th century)

## BlueMarble Integration

### Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1**: 20 core professions (farming, mining, smithing, etc.)
- **Phase 2**: 50 professions (add specialists and traders)
- **Phase 3**: 100 professions (full medieval economy)
- **Phase 4**: 150+ professions (early modern expansion)

### Mapping to BlueMarble Skills
All 305 jobs mapped to BlueMarble's 15 core skills:
- Mining → Geological extraction professions
- Blacksmithing → Metal working specializations
- Woodworking → Carpentry and construction trades
- Herbalism → Medical and agricultural professions
- etc.

### Guild System Implementation
- Apprenticeship mechanics (7-10 year progression)
- Journeyman wage labor and travel
- Master status and business ownership
- Guild benefits and quality bonuses
- Economic regulation and pricing

## Authenticity Considerations

### Gender and Class
- Historical accuracy vs. modern sensibilities
- Documented exceptions to gender restrictions
- Class mobility through exceptional skill
- Regional and temporal variations

### Regional Variations
- Mediterranean urban centers (large craft sectors)
- Northern European agricultural focus
- Islamic Golden Age influence (8th-13th century)
- Late medieval urbanization trends

## Key Findings

### Specialization Depth
Medieval professions were highly specialized, with 305+ distinct occupations supporting complex economies even at relatively small population scales.

### Guild Importance
Guilds provided training, quality control, economic regulation, and social support - essential for profession system depth.

### Technology Progression
Technological advances (water power, printing, navigation) created new professions and transformed existing ones, providing model for BlueMarble's technology tree.

### Economic Interdependence
Complex web of specialized professions created natural economic interdependence, similar to desired BlueMarble gameplay patterns.
