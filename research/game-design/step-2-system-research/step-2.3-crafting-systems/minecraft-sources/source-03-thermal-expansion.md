# Source Analysis: Thermal Expansion

**Source Type:** Official Mod Documentation  
**Source:** Thermal Series Wiki (https://teamcofh.com/docs/)  
**Date Accessed:** 2025-01-15  
**Relevance:** Very High - Streamlined progression with consistent design patterns

## Source Overview

Thermal Expansion is renowned for its polished, consistent design. It implements a unified power system (Redstone Flux/RF) and establishes clear tier progression that became an industry standard. The mod prioritizes player-friendly design while maintaining depth.

## Key Findings

### 1. Unified Tier System

Thermal Expansion implements consistent upgrade paths across all machines:

```
Tier Progression:
Basic → Hardened → Reinforced → Signalum → Resonant

Each tier:
├── +25% processing speed
├── +50% energy efficiency
├── +1 augment slot
└── Consistent upgrade recipe pattern

Example - Pulverizer:
Basic Pulverizer (1x speed, no augments)
↓
Hardened Pulverizer (1.25x speed, 1 augment)
↓
Reinforced Pulverizer (1.5x speed, 2 augments)
↓
Signalum Pulverizer (1.75x speed, 3 augments)
↓
Resonant Pulverizer (2x speed, 4 augments)
```

**Relevance to BlueMarble:** Consistent upgrade patterns reduce player confusion. BlueMarble can implement similar consistency: each facility tier follows same upgrade pattern (better materials → better performance).

### 2. Byproduct Generation System

Thermal Expansion introduces secondary outputs that create interconnected economies:

```
Pulverizer Processing:
Iron Ore → Iron Dust (primary) + Nickel Dust (10% chance, secondary)
Copper Ore → Copper Dust (primary) + Gold Dust (10% chance)
Tin Ore → Tin Dust (primary) + Iron Dust (5% chance)

Benefits:
├── Every resource has multiple uses
├── "Waste" becomes valuable
├── Creates trading opportunities
└── Adds depth without complexity
```

**Relevance to BlueMarble:** Realistic ore processing generates byproducts. BlueMarble's geological accuracy naturally creates this - iron ore with silica byproducts, copper with trace gold, etc.

### 3. Augment System (Machine Customization)

Thermal allows players to customize machines with augments:

```
Common Augments:
├── Processing Speed (+50% speed, +100% energy use)
├── Fuel Efficiency (-25% energy, -25% speed)
├── Secondary Output (+15% byproduct chance)
├── Ore Tripling (requires special materials)
└── Auto-Output (eliminates pipe needs)

Player Choice:
Speed vs. Efficiency vs. Output quantity
Customization based on resource availability
Different builds for different situations
```

**Relevance to BlueMarble:** Player agency in optimization. BlueMarble can offer similar choices: processing quality vs. speed, yield vs. power consumption, automation vs. manual control.

### 4. Redstone Flux (RF) Power System

Thermal Expansion established RF as the universal power standard:

```
Power Generation:
Steam Dynamo (coal + water) → 40 RF/t
├── Early game, reliable
└── Moderate efficiency

Compression Dynamo (fuel) → 80 RF/t
├── Mid-game
└── Requires refined fuel

Magmatic Dynamo (lava) → 80 RF/t
├── Location-dependent
└── Renewable with pumps

Numismatic Dynamo (emeralds) → 80 RF/t
├── Late-game "money burning"
└── Converts excess wealth to power

Power Distribution:
├── No power loss in cables
├── Simple connection
└── Focus on generation, not transmission
```

**Relevance to BlueMarble:** Simplified power system reduces busywork while maintaining depth. BlueMarble can balance realism (power transmission matters) with playability (not overly punishing).

### 5. Invar Alloy and Material Dependencies

Thermal introduces alloy systems that gate progression:

```
Bronze (Copper + Tin) → Early machines
Invar (Iron + Nickel) → Machine frames
Signalum (Copper + Silver + Redstone) → Advanced tier
Enderium (Tin + Silver + Ender Pearl) → Top tier

Material Gates:
├── Nickel (requires processing copper ore byproducts)
├── Silver (rare ore or gold byproduct)
├── Ender Pearls (requires combat or trade)
└── Creates natural progression pacing
```

**Relevance to BlueMarble:** Alloy systems add depth to material processing. BlueMarble's geological realism naturally supports this - steel requires iron + carbon, bronze requires copper + tin.

## Design Patterns Identified

### Pattern: Consistent Visual Language

All Thermal machines share design elements:
- Similar shapes/sizes
- Color-coded tiers (copper → silver → gold → diamond blue)
- Unified UI layouts
- Predictable upgrade paths

This consistency reduces learning curve for new players.

### Pattern: Secondary Output Economy

Every process generates useful byproducts:
- Ore processing → trace metals
- Smelting → slag (building material)
- Fluid processing → secondary fluids

Nothing is truly "waste" - creates circular economy.

### Pattern: Gradual Efficiency Unlocks

Progression rewards investment:

```
Tier 1: 2x ore processing (basic efficiency)
Tier 2: 2x + byproducts (10% secondary)
Tier 3: 2x + byproducts (15% secondary) + speed
Tier 4: 3x ore processing (with rare augments)
Tier 5: Maximum efficiency + customization
```

Each tier feels like meaningful advancement.

### Pattern: Player Choice Through Augments

Instead of "one optimal solution", augments enable:
- Speed builds (rapid processing)
- Efficiency builds (low power consumption)
- Yield builds (maximum output)
- Balanced builds (moderate everything)

Different situations favor different builds.

## Newly Discovered Sources

While analyzing Thermal Expansion, related resources discovered:

1. **Thermal Foundation** - Base materials and resources
2. **Thermal Dynamics** - Advanced item/fluid transport
3. **Thermal Innovation** - Additional machines and tools
4. **Thermal Cultivation** - Agricultural systems
5. **CoFH Core** - Core framework used by Thermal series

These sources saved for potential future analysis.

## Recommendations for BlueMarble

1. **Consistent Tier System:** Apply same upgrade pattern across all facilities (materials → performance → customization)
2. **Byproduct Integration:** Every ore processing should generate geologically accurate byproducts
3. **Customization Options:** Allow players to optimize facilities for speed, efficiency, or yield
4. **Visual Consistency:** Use consistent UI/visual patterns across similar facilities
5. **Gradual Unlocks:** Each tier should feel like meaningful advancement, not just bigger numbers

## Connection to BlueMarble's Goals

Thermal Expansion's design philosophy strongly aligns with BlueMarble:

- **Tier Consistency:** Thermal's upgrade tiers ↔ BlueMarble's facility improvement levels
- **Byproducts:** Thermal's secondary outputs ↔ BlueMarble's realistic mineral byproducts
- **Customization:** Thermal's augments ↔ BlueMarble's facility specialization choices
- **Progression:** Thermal's gradual efficiency ↔ BlueMarble's technological advancement

## Summary

Thermal Expansion demonstrates that sophisticated systems can be approachable through consistent design patterns. Its unified tier system, byproduct generation, and player customization options provide an excellent blueprint for BlueMarble's processing facilities. The mod proves that depth and accessibility are not mutually exclusive when design is consistent and intuitive.

**Key Lesson:** Consistency in design reduces cognitive load, allowing players to engage with system depth rather than struggling with interface differences.
