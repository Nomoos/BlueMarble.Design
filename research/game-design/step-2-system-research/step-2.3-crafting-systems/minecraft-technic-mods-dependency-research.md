Tier 2: Shallow mining (0-50m depth)
├── Iron ore deposits
├── Copper veins
├── Coal seams
└── Requires: Mining infrastructure

Tier 3: Deep mining (50-200m depth)
├── Gold deposits
├── Silver veins
├── Rich ore bodies
└── Requires: Advanced support, drainage

Tier 4: Extreme depth (200m+ depth)
├── Rare earth elements
├── Gem formations
├── High-grade ores
└── Requires: Ventilation, power systems

Tier 5: Special processing

└── Requires: Complex infrastructure
```

**Advantages Over Arbitrary Gates:**
- Naturally realistic
- Educationally valuable
- Emerges from simulation
- Feels earned, not artificial

### Infrastructure Dependencies Match Geological Reality

**BlueMarble Mining Operations:**

```
Deep Mine Requirements (realistic):
├── Ventilation: Air circulation (gas hazards real)
├── Drainage: Water pumping (groundwater real)
├── Support: Structural reinforcement (collapse risk real)
├── Transport: Ore hauling (gravity and distance real)
└── Power: Machinery operation (energy needs real)

Matches Technic pattern:
Machine requires supporting infrastructure
```

**Design Insight:** BlueMarble's realism creates same engaging infrastructure gameplay as Technic mods, but emerges naturally from geology rather than game design.

### Material Processing Chains

**Realistic Geological Processing:**

```
Copper Ore Processing (Real-world inspired):

Stage 1: Beneficiation
Raw ore → Crusher → Concentration → Copper-rich material
(Same as Technic mods' basic processing)

Stage 2: Smelting
Concentrated ore → Roaster → Smelter → Blister copper
(Matches multi-stage mod processing)

Stage 3: Refining
Blister copper → Converter → Fire refining → Pure copper
(Like Technic end-game processing)

Stage 4: Electrorefining (optional)
Pure copper → Electrolysis → 99.99% pure copper
(Matches expert-mode extended processing)
```

**BlueMarble Advantage:** Real geology provides the complex processing chains that Technic mods create artificially.

### Power System Opportunities

**Realistic Power Progression:**

```
Stage 1: Mechanical power
├── Water wheels (river flow required)
├── Windmills (elevation/wind patterns)
└── Manual labor (player-powered)

Stage 2: Steam power
├── Coal burning (requires mining)
├── Steam engines (water + heat)
└── Boilers (material quality matters)

Stage 3: Electrical power
├── Generators (mechanical → electrical)
├── Transmission lines (distance costs)
└── Grid infrastructure (distribution network)

Stage 4: Advanced power
├── Geothermal (specific locations)
├── Hydroelectric (dam construction)
└── Solar/wind farms (location dependent)
```

**Design Pattern:** Matches Technic power progression but with geological constraints adding spatial gameplay.

### Automation Philosophy

**BlueMarble Automation Approach:**

```
Level 1: Manual operation
Player performs all tasks directly

Level 2: Basic mechanization
├── Water-powered hammers
├── Conveyor systems
└── Simple sorting

Level 3: Semi-automation
├── Scheduled operations
├── Batch processing
└── Supervised systems

Level 4: Full automation
├── Autonomous machinery
├── Smart logistics
└── Integrated factories

Level 5: Optimization
├── AI-managed systems
├── Predictive maintenance
└── Self-improving processes
```

**Balance Point:** Follow Technic's pattern - automation as reward, not early-game shortcut.

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Implement Five-Tier Material Progression

**Description:**

Structure material processing to match proven Technic pattern:

```
Tier 1: 1x yield (vanilla, manual)
Tier 2: 2x yield (basic machinery)
Tier 3: 2.5x yield (advanced processing + byproducts)
Tier 4: 3-4x yield (industrial scale + chemicals)
Tier 5: Maximum efficiency (optimization + rare materials)
```

**Rationale:**
- Proven to create engaging progression
- Clear goals at each tier
- Justifies infrastructure investment
- Natural pacing (players spend appropriate time per tier)

**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** Phase 2 (System Design)

**Implementation:**

```csharp
public class MaterialProcessingTier
{
    public int TierLevel { get; set; }
    public float BaseYieldMultiplier { get; set; }
    public List<ByproductChance> Byproducts { get; set; }
    public List<InfrastructureRequirement> Requirements { get; set; }
    
    public ProcessingResult ProcessMaterial(RawMaterial material, PlayerSkill skill)
    {
        // Calculate yield based on tier and player skill
        float finalYield = BaseYieldMultiplier * skill.ProcessingBonus;
        
        // Roll for byproducts
        var generatedByproducts = RollByproducts(material, Byproducts);
        
        return new ProcessingResult
        {
            PrimaryOutput = material.PrimaryMineral * finalYield,
            SecondaryOutputs = generatedByproducts,
            QualityLevel = CalculateQuality(material, skill, TierLevel)
        };
    }
}
```

### Recommendation 2: Infrastructure-Dependent Operations

**Description:**

Require supporting infrastructure before advanced operations possible:

```
Deep Mining Operation Requirements:
├── Ventilation shaft (every 100m depth)
├── Drainage pump (groundwater > threshold)
├── Support structures (geological stability < 70%)
├── Power supply (machinery operation)
└── Transport system (ore extraction)
```

**Rationale:**
- Creates base-building gameplay
- Rewards planning and engineering
- Makes advancement feel substantial
- Realistic geological constraints

**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** Phase 2-3 (Core Mining Systems)

**Implementation:**

```csharp
public class MiningOperation
{
    public bool ValidateInfrastructure(Vector3 miningLocation, int depth)
    {
        var requirements = new List<InfrastructureCheck>();
        
        // Ventilation check
        if (depth > 50)
        {
            int requiredVentShafts = depth / 100;
            int existingVentShafts = CountNearbyVentilation(miningLocation, radius: 100);
            
            if (existingVentShafts < requiredVentShafts)
            {
                return false; // Cannot proceed without ventilation
            }
        }
        
        // Drainage check
        var groundwaterLevel = GeologicalSimulation.GetGroundwaterLevel(miningLocation);
        if (groundwaterLevel > depth)
        {
            if (!HasDrainagePump(miningLocation, depth))
            {
                return false; // Cannot mine below water table without drainage
            }
        }
        
        // Structural stability check
        var stability = GeologicalSimulation.CalculateStability(miningLocation, depth);
        if (stability < 0.7f)
        {
            int requiredSupports = CalculateRequiredSupports(stability);
            if (GetExistingSupports(miningLocation) < requiredSupports)
            {
                return false; // Unsafe to mine without support
            }
        }
        
        return true; // All requirements met
    }
}
```

### Recommendation 3: Byproduct Generation System

**Description:**

All processing generates secondary materials:

```
Iron Ore Processing:
├── Primary: Iron ingots (90%)
├── Secondary: Silica (5-10% by weight)
├── Tertiary: Trace elements (Cu, Ni, Co) (<1%)
└── Waste: Slag (15-20%, usable for construction)
```

**Rationale:**
- Mirrors real geology
- Creates interconnected economy
- Reduces waste (everything useful)
- Adds depth without overwhelming complexity

**Priority:** Medium  
**Timeline:** Phase 3 (Processing Systems)

### Recommendation 4: Visible Material Flow

**Description:**

Make material movement visible in game world:

- Conveyor belts show items moving
- Pipes show fluid flow (animation or particles)
- Ore carts on rails for transport
- Storage systems show fill levels

**Rationale:**
- Aids player understanding
- Creates visual interest
- Satisfying feedback
- Debugging easier (see where things go wrong)

**Priority:** Medium  
**Timeline:** Phase 4 (Visualization)

### Recommendation 5: Progressive Automation

**Description:**

Automation as reward, not starting point:

```
Hour 0-10: Manual operations (player does everything)
Hour 10-30: Basic mechanization (water wheels, simple machines)
Hour 30-100: Semi-automation (batch processing, scheduled ops)
Hour 100+: Full automation (integrated factories, smart systems)
```

**Rationale:**
- Players appreciate automation after manual grind
- Maintains engagement early game
- Rewards progression
- Prevents "set and forget" early boredom

**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** All phases (design principle)

### Recommendation 6: Multiple Processing Paths

**Description:**

Allow different approaches to same goal:

```
Copper Extraction Options:

Path A: Traditional smelting
├── Fast setup
├── Moderate efficiency (1.5x)
├── Simple infrastructure
└── Good for early game

Path B: Roasting + reduction
├── Complex setup
├── High efficiency (2.5x)
├── Requires chemicals
└── Good for established base

Path C: Heap leaching
├── Slow processing
├── Moderate efficiency (2x)
├── Minimal infrastructure
└── Good for remote locations

Path D: Electrowinning
├── Very complex setup
├── Maximum purity (99.9%)
├── High power needs
└── End-game optimization
```

**Rationale:**
- Player choice and agency
- Different playstyles supported
- Replayability value
- Educational (multiple real techniques)

**Priority:** Medium  
**Timeline:** Phase 3-4 (Advanced Systems)

### Recommendation 7: Unified Resource Standards

**Description:**

Create consistent naming and compatibility:

```
Material Standards:
├── All copper is copper (no mod-specific variants)
├── Quality affects properties, not identity
├── Processing methods interchangeable
└── Tools work on appropriate materials
```

**Rationale:**
- Reduces confusion
- Enables mod/expansion compatibility
- Simplifies systems
- Follows industry best practices

**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** Phase 1 (Foundation)

### Recommendation 8: Quest/Tutorial System
