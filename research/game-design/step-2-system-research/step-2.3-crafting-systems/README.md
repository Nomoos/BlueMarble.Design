# Step 2.3: Crafting Systems

## Overview

Research on advanced crafting mechanics and base workflow design from leading MMORPGs, focusing on interactive multi-stage crafting, property-based material selection, and player control systems.

## Research Content

- [Advanced Crafting System Research](advanced-crafting-system-research.md) - Industry trends in flexible material selection, risk/reward mechanics, and player control
- [Base Crafting Workflows Research](base-crafting-workflows-research.md) - Tool integration, workstation proximity, and UI/UX patterns for accessible crafting
- [Minecraft Technic Mods Dependency Research](minecraft-technic-mods-dependency-research.md) - Analysis of realistic technology progression and dependency systems in Technic modpacks

## Key Crafting Patterns

### Advanced Crafting Mechanics
- **Flexible Material Selection**: Property-based requirements enable optimization
- **Risk/Reward Systems**: Material loss, tool degradation, crafting injuries
- **Player Control**: Material bonuses, quality outcomes, technique selection
- **Multi-stage Processes**: Interactive phases rewarding mastery
- **Quality Stratification**: Economic tiers based on crafting outcomes

### Base Workflow Design
- **Discovery → Preparation → Execution** phases for all crafting
- **Tool Selection**: Quality modifiers, efficiency, durability systems
- **Workstation Proximity**: 4-zone graduated benefit model (0-2m, 2-10m, 10-30m, 30m+)
- **Smart Defaults**: Material selection with manual override options
- **Queue Management**: Bulk crafting without repetitive clicking
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity scales with player expertise

### Dependency System Patterns
- **Tiered Material Gates**: Each tier requires materials from previous tier
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Machines require supporting systems (power, water, ventilation)
- **Byproduct Chains**: Processing generates secondary outputs used in other processes
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Complex products require sequential processes
- **Alternate Paths**: Multiple valid approaches to achieving same goal
