# Step 2: System Research

## Overview

This step contains comprehensive research on game systems from leading MMORPGs and sandbox games, organized into specialized sub-areas for skill systems, material systems, crafting mechanics, and historical authenticity.

## Sub-steps

1. **[Step 2.1: Skill Systems](step-2.1-skill-systems/)** - Skill progression, knowledge systems, and specialization mechanics
2. **[Step 2.2: Material Systems](step-2.2-material-systems/)** - Material quality, geological integration, and property systems
3. **[Step 2.3: Crafting Systems](step-2.3-crafting-systems/)** - Advanced crafting mechanics and workflow design
4. **[Step 2.4: Historical Research](step-2.4-historical-research/)** - Authentic historical professions and guild systems

Each sub-step contains detailed analysis of multiple reference games and actionable recommendations for BlueMarble integration.

## Research Approach

### Comparative Analysis
- Examine 8+ leading MMORPGs and sandbox games
- Identify best practices and proven mechanics
- Analyze trade-offs and design decisions
- Extract lessons applicable to geological simulation

### Reference Games
- World of Warcraft (skill/talent systems)
- Life is Feudal (specialization and material quality)
- Mortal Online 2 (multi-property materials)
- Novus Inceptio (geological integration)
- Wurm Online (skill progression)
- Vintage Story (knowledge discovery)
- Eco Global Survival (collaborative specialization)
- Port Royale 1 & The Guild 1400 (economic simulation)

## Key Research Themes

### Skill Progression
- Use-based vs. experience-based progression
- Hard skill caps forcing specialization
- Parent-child skill relationships
- Knowledge systems and discovery mechanics

### Material Quality
- Geological formation impact on quality
- Multi-property material systems
- Quality inheritance through processing chains
- Economic stratification by quality tiers

### Crafting Depth
- Multi-stage interactive crafting
- Property-based material requirements
- Risk/reward mechanics
- Player control and mastery systems

### Historical Authenticity
- Medieval professions and guild structures
- Apprenticeship progression systems
- Economic interdependence
- Realistic specialization pathways
