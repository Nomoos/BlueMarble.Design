# Step 2: System Research

## Overview

This step contains comprehensive research on game systems from leading MMORPGs and sandbox games, organized into specialized sub-areas for skill systems, material systems, crafting mechanics, and historical authenticity.

## Sub-steps

1. **[Step 2.1: Skill Systems](step-2.1-skill-systems/)** - Skill progression, knowledge systems, and specialization mechanics
2. **[Step 2.2: Material Systems](step-2.2-material-systems/)** - Material quality, geological integration, and property systems
3. **[Step 2.3: Crafting Systems](step-2.3-crafting-systems/)** - Advanced crafting mechanics and workflow design
4. **[Step 2.4: Historical Research](step-2.4-historical-research/)** - Authentic historical professions and guild systems
5. **[Step 2.5: Economy Systems](step-2.5-economy-systems/)** - Player-driven economies, quest contracts, and market mechanics
5. **[Step 2.5: Player Experience](step-2.5-player-experience/)** - Player psychology, demographics, and gameplay preferences
5. **[Step 2.5: Economy Systems](step-2.5-economy-systems/)** - Player-driven markets, quest contracts, and trading mechanisms
5. **[Step 2.5: Player Economy Behavior](step-2.5-player-economy-behavior/)** - Player pricing behavior, time valuation, and market dynamics
5. **[Step 2.5: Quest and Contract Systems](step-2.5-quest-systems/)** - Player-created content, repeatable quests vs one-time contracts
6. **[Step 2.6: Weather and Climate Systems](step-2.6-weather-climate-systems/)** - Weather modeling, seasonal cycles, and climate change mechanics

Each sub-step contains detailed analysis of multiple reference games and actionable recommendations for BlueMarble integration.
