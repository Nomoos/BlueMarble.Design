## Executive Summary

Economy-focused players often treat quest systems not as traditional narrative content but as economic contracts—mini-auctions where they evaluate risk vs. reward, opportunity cost, and market efficiency. This research examines how MMORPGs implement quest systems that function as economic contracts, how players leverage these for profit, and how this differs from traditional market systems.

**Key Takeaways for BlueMarble:**

- **Contract-based quests** enable dynamic player-to-player economic relationships beyond static markets
- **Auction mechanics** in quest systems create competitive pricing for player services
- **Reputation systems** are crucial for trust in contract fulfillment
- **Quest boards** serve as decentralized marketplaces for player-generated content
- **Bounty systems** allow players to post tasks at their own pricing
- **Crafting orders** merge quest mechanics with market systems for custom goods

**Relevance to BlueMarble:**

BlueMarble's resource-based economy (geological samples, field surveys, data analysis) is perfectly suited for contract-based quest systems. Players can post collection contracts, survey missions, and analysis tasks, creating a dynamic economy where specialized players fulfill contracts for profit while advancing scientific knowledge.

## Part I: Contract-Based Quest Systems

### 1. EVE Online: Contracts as Economic Instruments

**Overview:**

EVE Online's contract system is the gold standard for treating quests as economic contracts. Players create contracts for item delivery, courier services, resource exchange, and even mercenary work.

**Contract Types:**

```
1. Item Exchange Contracts
   - Seller lists items at fixed price
   - Buyer accepts and pays immediately
   - Like auction house but structured as quest
   - Enables bulk deals and bundled items
   
   Example:
   Contract: "50,000 units Tritanium + 25,000 units Pyerite"
   Price: 5,000,000 ISK
   Duration: 7 days
   Collateral: N/A
   Status: Available

2. Courier Contracts
   - Item transport from Point A to Point B
   - Issuer sets reward and collateral
   - Contractor receives reward upon delivery
   - Collateral covers loss if failed
   
   Example:
   Contract: "Transport 1,000m³ cargo"
   Route: Jita → Amarr (23 jumps)
   Reward: 2,000,000 ISK
   Collateral: 50,000,000 ISK
   Duration: 3 days
   Risk: High-sec route (safer)

3. Auction Contracts
   - Highest bidder wins item
   - Time-limited bidding window
   - Automatic completion
   - Creates price discovery
   
   Example:
   Item: Rare blueprint
   Starting Bid: 100,000,000 ISK
   Current Bid: 245,000,000 ISK
   Bids: 14
   Time Left: 2 hours 15 minutes

4. Mercenary Contracts
   - Military services for hire
   - Structure bashing, defense, escorts
   - Negotiated pricing
   - Reputation-based system
   
   Example:
   Contract: "Defend POS for 1 week"
   System: 0.3 low-sec
   Reward: 500,000,000 ISK/week
   Requirements: 25+ pilots, Capital ships
   Duration: Negotiable
```

**Key Design Features:**

```
1. Collateral System
   - Protects both parties from fraud
   - Issuer sets collateral amount
   - Contractor posts collateral to accept
   - Collateral returned on successful completion
   - Collateral forfeited on failure
   
   Risk Management:
   - High-value cargo = high collateral
   - Low collateral = higher risk for issuer
   - Balance creates fair pricing

2. Public vs. Private Contracts
   - Public: Anyone can accept
   - Private: Sent to specific player/corporation
   - Enables trusted relationships
   - Supports repeat business
   
   Use Cases:
   - Public: Competitive courier routes
   - Private: Sensitive cargo, trusted partners

3. Search and Filter System
   - Filter by type, location, reward
   - Sort by profitability, distance, risk
   - Favorite contractors
   - Reputation indicators
   
   Player Tools:
   - Third-party contract calculators
   - Route optimization tools
   - Profitability analyzers
   - Risk assessment add-ons

4. Contract Failure Mechanics
   - Time expiration returns items to issuer
   - Contract breach forfeits collateral
   - Reputation system tracks failures
   - Failed contracts visible in history
   
   Consequences:
   - Poor reputation = fewer acceptances
   - Repeated failures = blacklisting
   - Trust is earned over time
```

**Economic Impact:**

```

   - Bid accordingly
   
   Example Calculation:
   Item Market Value: 80,000 silver
   Materials Value: 45,000 silver
   Potential Profit: 35,000 silver
   Time Required: 30 minutes
   Hourly Rate: 70,000 silver/hour
   
   Decision: Accept order at 50,000 silver offer
   Actual Profit: 50,000 (payment) - 5,000 (fees) = 45,000 silver
   Better than market sale after fees (35,000)

2. Competitive Bidding
   - Multiple crafters can bid
   - Buyer chooses based on reputation + price
   - Fast completion bonus
   - Bulk order discounts
   
   Bidding Example:

- Higher transaction costs
- Requires negotiation
- Time-consuming matching
- Risk of non-completion
```

**Use Case Matrix:**

```
Use Markets When:
✓ Standardized goods (coal, iron, common materials)
✓ High trade volume (thousands of units)
✓ No quality differentiation needed
✓ Instant transaction desired
✓ Anonymous trading preferred
✓ Commodity pricing acceptable

Examples in BlueMarble:
- Common rock samples (granite, limestone)
- Basic field equipment
- Standard laboratory supplies
- Processed data (standardized format)

Use Contracts When:
✓ Custom work required
✓ Quality matters significantly
✓ Service-based (not just goods)
✓ Long-term relationships valuable
✓ Trust and reputation important
✓ Unique or rare items/services

Examples in BlueMarble:
- Custom geological surveys
- Specialized equipment fabrication
- Expert analysis services
- Rare sample collection
- Expedition support services
- Research collaborations
```

**Hybrid Approaches:**

```
1. Market + Contracts Combo
   - Market for materials
   - Contracts for crafting services
   - Example: Buy iron ore from market, hire smith via contract
   
   BlueMarble Example:
   - Buy common samples from market
   - Hire specialist to conduct custom analysis via contract
   - Results in unique research output

2. Contracts with Market Pricing
   - Contract structure for service
   - Pricing referenced to market rates
   - Best of both worlds
   
   BlueMarble Example:
   Contract: "Deliver 100 basalt samples"
   Pricing: Market rate (500 credits/sample) + 10% service fee
   Total: 55,000 credits

3. Escrow-Based Contracts
   - Market-like instant settlement
   - Contract-like custom terms
   - Automated enforcement
   
   BlueMarble Example:
   - Player posts contract with escrow
   - Credits locked until delivery
   - Automatic release on confirmation
   - Dispute resolution if needed

4. Auction-Style Contracts
   - Multiple bidders compete
   - Market-style price discovery
   - Contract-style service delivery
   
   BlueMarble Example:
   Request: "Survey 50km² region"
   Bids:
   - Surveyor A: 75,000 credits, 10 days
   - Surveyor B: 65,000 credits, 14 days
   - Surveyor C: 85,000 credits, 7 days
   Client chooses best value proposition
```

### 6. Path of Exile: Contract League Mechanics

**Overview:**

Path of Exile's "Heist" league introduced contract-based gameplay where players choose missions (contracts) with varying risk/reward profiles. While PvE, the economic decision-making mirrors player-to-player contracts.

**Contract Selection Economics:**

```
Contract Properties:
- Target: What you're stealing (reward type)
- Difficulty: Enemy level and defenses
- Modifiers: Additional challenges or rewards
- Cost: Entry fee or resource investment
- Failure Penalty: Lost resources if you die

Economic Decision Framework:

1. Risk Assessment
   Low Risk: Easy enemies, minor rewards
   Medium Risk: Moderate enemies, good rewards
   High Risk: Dangerous enemies, excellent rewards
   
   Example Comparison:
   Contract A: 80% success rate, 10,000 gold reward
   Contract B: 50% success rate, 30,000 gold reward
   
   Expected Value:
   Contract A: 0.80 × 10,000 = 8,000 gold EV
   Contract B: 0.50 × 30,000 = 15,000 gold EV
   
   Decision: Contract B higher EV if risk tolerance allows

2. Opportunity Cost
   - Contract completion time
   - Alternative activities
   - Skill suitability
   
   Time Analysis:
   Contract A: 15 minutes, 8,000 gold EV = 32,000 gold/hour
   Contract B: 30 minutes, 15,000 gold EV = 30,000 gold/hour
   
   Decision: Contract A better gold per hour despite lower EV

3. Specialization Bonus
   - Player build affects success rate
   - Specialized builds excel at specific contracts
   - Creates market for contract trading
   
   Build Specialization:
   Tank Build: +20% success rate on combat contracts
   Speed Build: -30% time on timed contracts
   Stealth Build: +15% success rate on stealth contracts
   
   Optimal Strategy: Focus on contracts matching your build

4. Contract Trading
   - Players can trade contracts
   - Price based on difficulty and rewards
   - Specialists buy contracts suited to them
   - Creates contract marketplace
   
   Market Example:
   Generic Contract: 100 currency base price
   High-Reward Contract: 500 currency
   Specialized Contract: 300 currency (only some builds can do)
   
   Trading Strategy:
   - Sell contracts unsuited to your build
   - Buy contracts matching your specialization
   - Profit from arbitrage
```

**BlueMarble Application:**

```
Geological Mission Economics:

1. Risk-Tiered Missions
   - Low Risk: Safe areas, common samples
   - Medium Risk: Remote areas, specialized samples
   - High Risk: Dangerous areas, rare samples
   
   Mission A: Urban Geology Survey
   Location: Seattle metro area
   Risk: Very Low (no hazards)
   Reward: 5,000 credits
   Time: 2 hours
   Success Rate: 98%
   Expected Value: 4,900 credits
   
   Mission B: Alpine Glacier Sampling
   Location: North Cascades
   Risk: High (weather, terrain)
   Reward: 45,000 credits
   Time: 3 days
   Success Rate: 70% (failure = lost time/supplies)
   Expected Value: 31,500 credits
   
   Mission C: Deep Ocean Core Drilling
   Location: Pacific Ocean
   Risk: Very High (equipment cost, technical difficulty)
   Reward: 200,000 credits
   Time: 2 weeks
   Success Rate: 50%
   Expected Value: 100,000 credits
   Equipment Cost: 50,000 credits
   Net EV: 50,000 credits

2. Specialization-Based Missions
   - Volcanology missions
   - Seismology missions
   - Mineralogy missions
   - Each requires different skills
   
   Specialist Advantages:
   Volcanologist:
   - +30% success rate on volcanic missions
   - -20% time on lava sample collection
   - Access to exclusive high-risk/high-reward volcanic missions
   
   Seismologist:
   - +25% data quality from seismic surveys
   - Can accept earthquake emergency missions
   - Premium pay for rapid response capability
   
   Mineralogist:
   - +15% sample identification accuracy
   - Can appraise samples for other players
   - Access to rare mineral prospecting missions

3. Mission Trading Market
   - Players can trade mission contracts
   - Specialists buy relevant missions
   - Generalists sell specialized missions
   - Creates efficient allocation
   
   Example Trade:
   Player A (Generalist): Receives volcanic mission
   Player A: Can complete at 60% success rate
   Player B (Volcanologist): Can complete at 90% success rate
   
   Trade Negotiation:
   Mission Value: 50,000 credits reward
   Player A's EV: 30,000 credits (60% × 50,000)
   Player B's EV: 45,000 credits (90% × 50,000)
   
   Fair Trade Price: 35,000-40,000 credits
   Player A: Sells for 37,500 (profit without risk)
   Player B: Pays 37,500, keeps 12,500 profit (45,000 - 37,500)
   Win-win trade

4. Seasonal/Event Missions
   - Time-limited opportunities
   - Premium rewards
   - Competitive acceptance
   
   Example Event:
   "Yellowstone Thermal Activity Spike"
   Duration: 7 days
   Missions Available: 50 total
   First-Come: 20 missions (best rewards)
   Standard: 30 missions (good rewards)
   
   First-Come Missions:
   Reward: 100,000 credits + exclusive data access
   Requirements: Volcanology 70+, immediate availability
   
   Standard Missions:
   Reward: 60,000 credits
   Requirements: Geology 50+, complete within 7 days
   
   Player Strategy:
   - Monitor event notifications
   - Maintain readiness for rapid deployment
   - Network with organizations for early alerts
   - Build reputation for priority access
```

### 8. Balancing and Economic Management

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

```
Contract System Health:

1. Liquidity Metrics
   - Average time to contract acceptance
   - Percentage of contracts filled
   - Number of active contracts
   - Bid count per contract
   
   Targets:
   - 70%+ contracts accepted within 24 hours
   - 85%+ contracts filled before expiration
   - 500+ active contracts at any time
   - 3+ bids per auction contract

2. Pricing Efficiency
   - Contract rewards vs. market equivalents
   - Time to bid convergence
   - Price variance across similar contracts
   - Renegotiation frequency
   
   Targets:
   - Contract rewards within 20% of market rates
   - Bid convergence within 3 bids
   - <15% price variance for similar contracts
   - <5% renegotiation rate

3. Reputation System Health
   - Average completion rate
   - Rating distribution
   - Dispute rate
   - Repeat business rate
   
   Targets:
   - 85%+ completion rate overall
   - Bell curve rating distribution (centered at 4.0)
   - <3% dispute rate
   - 60%+ contracts with repeat partners

4. Player Engagement
   - Percentage of players using contracts
   - Contracts per active user
   - Time spent on contract activities
   - Satisfaction ratings
   
   Targets:
   - 40%+ players post/accept contracts monthly
   - 5+ contracts per active user per month
   - 20%+ of play time on contract activities
   - 4.0+ satisfaction rating

Economic Balance:

1. Contract vs. Market Balance
   - Revenue comparison: contracts vs. market trading
   - Time efficiency comparison
   - Player preference distribution
   - Economic arbitrage opportunities
   
   Goal: Both systems valuable, neither dominant

2. Reward Scaling
   - Entry-level contracts viable for newbies
   - Expert contracts rewarding for specialists
   - Progression path clear
   - No dead content
   
   Reward Tiers:
   Novice: 1,000-5,000 credits
   Intermediate: 5,000-25,000 credits
   Expert: 25,000-100,000 credits
   Master: 100,000+ credits

3. Risk-Reward Balance
   - Higher risk = proportionally higher reward
   - Risk tolerance options for all players
   - Insurance/hedging mechanisms available
   - Failure not catastrophic
   
   Risk Multipliers:
   Low Risk: 1.0x base reward
   Medium Risk: 1.5x base reward
   High Risk: 2.5x base reward
   Extreme Risk: 4.0x base reward

4. Supply-Demand Dynamics
   - Contract supply matches player demand
   - No contract spam/flooding
   - Desirable contracts fill quickly
   - Undesirable contracts auto-expire
   
   Auto-Adjustment:
   - Popular contract types boosted
   - Unpopular types reduced
   - NPC contracts fill gaps
   - Dynamic reward scaling
```

**Anti-Abuse Mechanisms:**

```
Fraud Prevention:

1. Reputation Decay
   - Inactive users lose reputation slowly
   - Prevents reputation squatting
   - Encourages ongoing participation
   
   Decay Rate: -1% per month inactive

2. Collateral Requirements
   - High-value contracts require collateral
   - Scales with reward amount
   - Prevents accept-and-abandon
   
   Collateral Formula:
   - Low Risk: 10% of reward
   - Medium Risk: 20% of reward
   - High Risk: 30% of reward

3. Completion History
   - Track completion rate per player
   - Flag accounts with low rates
   - Limit simultaneous contracts
   
   Simultaneous Limits:
   - <70% completion: 3 contracts max
   - 70-85% completion: 5 contracts max
   - 85-95% completion: 10 contracts max
   - >95% completion: 15 contracts max

4. Dispute Resolution
   - Third-party arbitration
   - Evidence submission
   - Partial compensation possible
   - Reputation impact
   
   Dispute Process:
   1. Party initiates dispute
   2. Both parties submit evidence
   3. Community arbitrators review
   4. Decision made within 48 hours
   5. Credits and reputation adjusted
   6. Appeals possible (once)

Market Manipulation Prevention:

1. Price Floors and Ceilings
   - Min/max rewards based on market data
   - Prevents undercutting exploitation
   - Prevents price gouging
   
   Example Limits:
   - Basalt Sample: 300-800 credits (market: 500)
   - Survey Mission: 30,000-90,000 credits (market equiv: 60,000)

2. Contract Cooldowns
   - Limit contract posting frequency
   - Prevents spam
   - Encourages quality over quantity
   
   Cooldowns:
   - Post limit: 10 contracts per day
   - Same contract type: 1 hour cooldown
   - Failed contracts: 3 hour penalty cooldown

3. Bid Manipulation Detection
   - Identify shill bidding
   - Track bid patterns
   - Ban coordinated manipulation
   
   Red Flags:
   - Same players always bidding on same issuer
   - Rapid bid cancellations
   - Unusual bid timing patterns
   - IP address correlation

4. Quality Enforcement
   - Random quality audits
   - Penalties for misrepresentation
   - Third-party quality certification
   
   Audit System:
   - 5% of contracts randomly audited
   - NPC verification of quality claims
   - Major penalties for fraud
   - Reputation bonuses for verified quality
```
