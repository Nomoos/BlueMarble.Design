# Step 2.5: Economy Systems Research

This directory contains research on economic systems in MMORPGs, with a focus on player-driven economies, market mechanics, and quest systems as economic instruments.

## Overview

Economy systems are a critical component of successful MMORPGs, providing players with meaningful choices, progression paths, and social interactions. This research examines how leading games implement economic systems and how players interact with these systems.

## Research Documents

### [Economy-Driven Quest Systems Research](economy-driven-quest-systems-research.md)
Comprehensive analysis of how economy-focused players use quests as contracts and mini-auctions versus traditional market systems.

**Key Topics:**
- Contract-based quest systems (EVE Online, Star Wars Galaxies)
- Auction-based quest mechanics (Albion Online, Path of Exile)
- Dynamic events as economic opportunities (Guild Wars 2)
- Comparison of contract systems vs. market systems
- Implementation recommendations for BlueMarble
- Database schemas and API designs
- Economic balancing and anti-abuse mechanisms

**Research Highlights:**
- EVE Online's contract system as the gold standard
- Player-created missions in Star Wars Galaxies
- Crafting orders as hybrid auction-market systems
- Contribution-based rewards in dynamic events
- When to use contracts vs. markets
- Hybrid economic models for optimal gameplay

**Applicability to BlueMarble:**
- Geological sample collection contracts
- Survey mission bidding systems
- Laboratory analysis orders
- Expedition support services
- Research collaboration frameworks
- Reputation systems for scientific work

## Integration with BlueMarble

### Core Economic Principles
1. **Hybrid Systems**: Combine traditional markets for commodities with contract systems for services
2. **Player Agency**: Enable players to create economic opportunities for others
3. **Trust Infrastructure**: Reputation, escrow, and dispute resolution mechanisms
4. **Specialization Rewards**: Economic incentives for developing expertise
5. **Quality Differentiation**: Economic systems that recognize and reward quality work

### Implementation Priorities

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Basic market system for commodity items
- Simple contract posting and acceptance
- Escrow payment system
- Reputation tracking

**Phase 2: Enhancement**
- Bidding system for contracts
- Contract templates
- Advanced reputation metrics
- Quality verification

**Phase 3: Advanced**
- Contract trading
- AI-based matching
- Complex multi-party contracts
- Guild/organization contracts

## Research Methodology

Economic system research focuses on:
1. **Real-World Analysis**: Examining functioning economies in live games
2. **Player Behavior**: Understanding how players optimize economic activities
3. **Design Patterns**: Identifying successful mechanisms
4. **Balance Considerations**: Risk-reward ratios, inflation control, market health
5. **Anti-Abuse**: Preventing exploitation and manipulation

## Contributing

When adding new economy research:
- Focus on player-driven economic systems
- Include concrete examples from functioning games
- Provide implementation recommendations for BlueMarble
- Consider geological/scientific context adaptations
- Document economic metrics and success criteria

## Next Steps

Potential future research areas:
- Guild/organization economic systems
- Player-created currency and trade goods
- Economic warfare and competition
- Cross-regional trade and arbitrage
- Event-driven economic shocks and responses
- Long-term economic simulation and balancing
