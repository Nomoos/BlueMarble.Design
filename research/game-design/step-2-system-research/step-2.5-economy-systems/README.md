# Step 2.5: Economy Systems

## Overview

This step contains research on economic systems in MMORPGs, focusing on player-driven markets, quest-based contracts, trading mechanisms, and how economy-focused players interact with these systems. The research examines both centralized market systems (like OSRS Grand Exchange) and decentralized contract/quest systems, analyzing when and why players choose each approach.

## Research Content

- [Quest Contracts vs Market Systems Research](quest-contracts-vs-market-systems-research.md) - Comparative analysis of quest-based contracts versus centralized market systems for economy-focused gameplay

## Key Findings

- **Market Systems Excel At**: High-volume commodity trading, price discovery, liquid standardized goods, anonymous transactions
- **Quest Contracts Excel At**: Unique/custom orders, relationship building, negotiated terms, specialized services, geographic specificity
- **Player Behavior**: Economy-focused players use both systems strategically - markets for standardized trading, contracts for specialized deals
- **Hybrid Approach**: Most successful economies provide both centralized markets and contract/quest systems to serve different player needs

## Implementation Considerations

- Quest-based contracts work well for geological samples with specific location/quality requirements
- Market systems handle bulk commodity trading of standardized resources
- Contract boards can create mini-auctions where multiple players bid on fulfilling quest requirements
- Both systems can coexist and complement each other in BlueMarble's economy

## Summary

Economy systems research reveals that successful MMORPGs provide multiple trading mechanisms to serve different player needs and transaction types. Quest-based contracts create engagement through personalization and negotiation, while market systems provide efficiency and liquidity. BlueMarble's geological research economy can benefit from implementing both systems to serve different use cases within the player-driven economy.
