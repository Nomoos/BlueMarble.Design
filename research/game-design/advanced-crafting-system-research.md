├── Weight: 7.85 g/cm³
├── Hardness: 72/100
├── Flexibility: 45/100
├── Yield Strength: 250 MPa
└── Thermal Conductivity: 50 W/mK

Recipe Requirements:
- Minimum thresholds for critical properties
- Weighted averages for multi-material items
- Trade-off visualization for player decisions
- No single "best" material for all applications
```

**Life is Feudal Approach:**
```
Quality-Based Substitution:
├── Tier 1 (Q: 0-30): Basic materials, low performance
├── Tier 2 (Q: 31-60): Standard materials, adequate performance
├── Tier 3 (Q: 61-85): Premium materials, high performance
└── Tier 4 (Q: 86-100): Exceptional materials, maximum performance

Within-Tier Flexibility:
- Any material within tier produces similar results
- Quality inheritance through processing
- Economic stratification by quality access
- Player skill compensates for lower quality
```

**Vintage Story Approach:**
```
Technology-Gated Material Access:
Stone Age → Copper Age → Bronze Age → Iron Age → Steel Age

Each tier unlocks:
- New material types
- Better processing methods
- Higher quality ceilings
- Advanced recipe variations

Within-Tier Selection:
- Geographic material variation
- Quality variance by deposit
- Environmental factors affect availability
- Exploration rewards with rare materials
```

#### 3. Material Combination Mechanics

**Additive Properties**

Materials contribute properties that add together:

```
Example: Composite Armor
- Steel Plate (Armor: 50, Weight: 8kg, Mobility: -10)
- Leather Padding (Armor: 5, Weight: 1kg, Mobility: +5)
- Chain Mail Links (Armor: 20, Weight: 4kg, Mobility: -5)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Final Result:
  Total Armor: 75
  Total Weight: 13kg
  Net Mobility: -10
```

**Weighted Average Properties**

Some properties average based on material contribution:

```
Example: Alloyed Metal Ingot
- Iron (60%, Hardness: 70, Ductility: 45)
- Carbon (5%, Hardness: 95, Ductility: 10)
- Chromium (35%, Hardness: 85, Ductility: 35)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Weighted Hardness:
  (70 × 0.60) + (95 × 0.05) + (85 × 0.35) = 76.5

Weighted Ductility:
  (45 × 0.60) + (10 × 0.05) + (35 × 0.35) = 39.75
```

**Synergy Bonuses**

Certain material combinations provide bonus effects:

```
Material Synergies:
✓ Damascus Steel + Exotic Wood Handle
  → +10% Aesthetic value
  → +5% Magic conductivity
  → Unlocks "Masterwork" quality tier

✓ Titanium + Carbon Fiber
  → +15% Strength-to-weight ratio
  → +20% Corrosion resistance
  → "Aerospace Grade" modifier

✓ Volcanic Rock + Obsidian Fragments
  → +25% Sharpness
  → Special "Volcanic Edge" effect
  → Geological authenticity bonus
```

#### 4. Material Rarity and Value Balance

**Balancing Accessibility vs. Power:**

```
Material Tier Design:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Common Materials (60% of recipes):
- Readily available everywhere
- Baseline performance (Quality: 40-60)
- Low cost, high volume
- Practice and learning materials

Uncommon Materials (25% of recipes):
- Regional availability
- Good performance (Quality: 60-75)
- Moderate cost and trade value
- Standard production materials

Rare Materials (12% of recipes):
- Limited geographic sources
- High performance (Quality: 75-90)
- Significant cost and trade value

Exceptional Materials (3% of recipes):
- Unique locations or conditions
- Maximum performance (Quality: 90-100)
- Very high cost, speculative value
- Masterwork and prestige items
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Diminishing Returns on Quality:**

```
Quality Impact on Final Stats:
  Q40 Material → Base Stats × 1.0 (baseline)
  Q60 Material → Base Stats × 1.3 (+30%)
  Q75 Material → Base Stats × 1.5 (+50%)
  Q90 Material → Base Stats × 1.65 (+65%)
  Q100 Material → Base Stats × 1.75 (+75%)

- Oak Handle × 1 (10 gold)
- Leather Strips × 2 (6 gold)
Total Investment: 96 gold

Success Rate: 75%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Outcome A (75% chance): SUCCESS
  → Steel Longsword created (value: 150-200 gold)
  → 50 XP gained
  → All materials consumed

Outcome B (25% chance): FAILURE
  → No item produced
  → All materials lost (96 gold loss)
  → 15 XP gained (consolation)
  → Possible skill gain from learning
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Partial Recovery Systems:**

```
Failure with Material Salvage:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
On Failure:
- 40-60% of materials recoverable as scrap
- Scrap quality lower than original
- Can be reprocessed but with efficiency loss
- Reduces absolute loss, maintains stakes

Example:
  Original: 4x Steel Ingot (Q:80) = 80 gold
  Salvage: 2x Scrap Steel (Q:45) = 25 gold
  Net Loss: 55 gold (vs 80 gold total loss)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Life is Feudal's "Pain Tolerance" System:**

```
Failure Compensation Mechanics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Consecutive Failure Counter:
  Failure 1: Standard material loss, +bonus XP
  Failure 2: Reduced material loss, +more bonus XP
  Failure 3+: Minimum material loss, ++XP, guaranteed success boost
