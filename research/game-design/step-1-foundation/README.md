# Step 1: Foundation

## Overview

This step establishes the foundational concepts for BlueMarble's game design, including world parameters, core mechanics, player agency philosophy, and curated research sources.

## Sub-steps

1. **World Parameters** - Technical specifications for the 3D spherical world
2. **Core Mechanics** - Game systems inspired by economic simulations
3. **Design Philosophy** - Player freedom through intelligent constraints
4. **Research Sources** - Curated game design theory and practice
5. **Design Process** - From inspiration to design documentation

## Key Concepts

### 3D World Parameters
- **Z-Dimension**: Â±10,000 km from sea level (20,000 km total)
- **Precision**: 64-bit integer for meter-level accuracy
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing BlueMarble architecture
- **Performance**: Real-time response for geological interaction

### Core Mechanics
- Dynamic supply/demand based on geological resources
- Production chains leveraging realistic material processing
- Multi-generational dynasty management
- Professional guilds and knowledge sharing
- Political influence through economic control

### Design Philosophy
- Constraints arise from geological reality, not arbitrary rules
- Knowledge directly translates to gameplay capabilities
- Multiple solution paths based on scientific principles
- Emergent complexity from simple, realistic rules
