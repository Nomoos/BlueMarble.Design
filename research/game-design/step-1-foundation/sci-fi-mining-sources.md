## Research Notes

### Key Insights from Initial Processing

**Narrative Strengths:**
- The sci-fi mining world concept has strong precedent in successful media
- Class stratification resonates with audiences (The Expanse's popularity)
- Clone/reproduction control creates interesting ethical dilemmas (Altered Carbon)
- Resource extraction grounds gameplay in tangible goals (Heinlein)

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overly dark/depressing settings can limit appeal
- Need balance between realism and fun
- Class systems risk making lower tiers feel bad to play
- Resource scarcity must create tension without frustration

**Design Opportunities:**
- Multi-faction systems allow for diverse playstyles
- Long-term projects create investment and community
- Physical/genetic differences justify gameplay variety
- Economic systems can be complex without being opaque

### Next Steps

**For Further Research:**
1. Process Queue Group 2 (Academic sources) to ground setting in realism
2. Process Queue Group 3 (Game design) to understand implementation
3. Process Queue Group 4 (Reddit) to gauge community interest and concerns
4. Process Queue Group 5 (GitHub) for technical implementation ideas
