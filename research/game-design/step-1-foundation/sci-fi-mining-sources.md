## Summary of Assignment Group 1

**Common Themes Across Sources:**
1. **Resource control as power** - All four sources feature distant authorities controlling populations through resource access
2. **Population stratification** - Multiple tiers/classes with different rights, capabilities, or lifespans
3. **Physical/genetic adaptation** - Bodies modified for specific purposes or environments
4. **Rebellion narratives** - Oppressed populations organizing resistance
5. **Economic exploitation** - Corporate or governmental control creating dependency
6. **Identity and belonging** - Characters struggling with what makes them "real" or valuable

**Unique Contributions:**

4. Body/genetic modification as character progression
5. Long-term projects requiring cooperation across generations
6. Rebellion mechanics and resistance organization
7. Economic systems tied to life necessities
8. Environmental adaptation creating gameplay variety
