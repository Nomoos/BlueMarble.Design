## Content Design in Tabletop RPGs

Tabletop RPGs approach content design fundamentally differently due to the presence of a human Game Master (GM) who dynamically creates content. However, published adventures show structured content design principles.

### Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition

**Publisher:** Wizards of the Coast  
**Content Design Philosophy:** Flexible frameworks for GM interpretation

#### Content Approach

**Module Structure:**
- Background and hooks
- Location descriptions
- NPC stat blocks and personalities
- Encounter tables
- Treasure lists
- Maps and handouts

**Tiered Difficulty:**
- Adventures designed for level ranges (1-5, 5-10, etc.)
- Encounter balance guidelines
- Scaling advice for different party sizes
- Optional harder variants

**Sandbox Elements:**
- Multiple quest threads in each module
- Non-linear progression options
- GM encouraged to improvise
- Player agency prioritized

#### Key Content Design Lessons

**1. Framework Not Script**

Module Example: "Lost Mine of Phandelver"
- Provides location key (what's in each room)
- Suggests NPC motivations (not exact dialogue)
- Offers encounter templates (GM adjusts difficulty)
- Encourages GM customization

This approach:
- Respects GM creativity
- Adapts to table dynamics
- Allows player innovation
- Scales to different groups

**2. Encounter Design**

5E Encounter Structure:
```
EASY: Resource drain, low danger
MEDIUM: Moderate challenge, expected difficulty
HARD: Major resource expenditure, real danger
DEADLY: Potential character death
```

Content uses mix:
- Several easy (pacing, tension breaks)
- Many medium (core challenge)
- Few hard (memorable moments)
- Rare deadly (climaxes only)

**3. Three-Pillar Design**

D&D content balances three activities:
- **Combat** (33%): Tactical encounters
- **Exploration** (33%): Discovery and problem-solving
- **Social** (33%): Roleplay and negotiation

Published adventures maintain this balance, though tables vary.

#### Content Patterns Used

- **Random Encounter Tables**: Procedural content between planned encounters
- **Rumor Tables**: Organic quest discovery
- **Faction Goals**: Multiple groups with competing objectives
- **Magic Item Placement**: Rewards strategic placement

### Dračí hlídka (Dragon Guard - Czech RPG)

**Publisher:** ALTAR  
**Content Design Philosophy:** Slavic mythology, tactical combat

#### Content Approach

**Cultural Grounding:**
- Adventures rooted in Slavic folklore
- Czech historical inspiration
- Mythology creates quest hooks
- Local legends drive content

**Tactical Focus:**
- Combat-heavy scenarios
- Positional tactics emphasized
- Resource management critical
- Preparation rewarded

**Community Content:**
- Strong homebrew tradition
- Fan-created adventures
- Shared resources
- Collaborative worldbuilding

#### Key Content Design Lessons

**1. Cultural Authenticity**

Adventures use Czech/Slavic elements:
- Folklore creatures (Vodník, Ježibaba)
- Historical settings (medieval Bohemia)
- Cultural practices (festivals, traditions)
- Local geography

Creates unique flavor distinct from Western fantasy.

**2. Tactical Encounter Design**

Combat encounters feature:
- Terrain importance (elevation, cover)
- Environmental hazards
- Multi-stage battles
- Intelligent enemy tactics

**3. Low-Magic Content**

Adventures designed for:
- Limited magical resources
- Mundane problem-solving
- Human-scale threats
- Gritty realism

**Applicability to BlueMarble:**
- Cultural authenticity parallels geological authenticity
- Resource scarcity creates meaningful choices
- Tactical thinking in guild conflicts
- Community-driven content potential

### Spire: The City Must Fall

**Publisher:** Rowan, Rook and Decard  
**Content Design Philosophy:** Narrative focus, revolutionary themes

#### Content Approach

**Stress-Based System:**
- No hit points, use stress/fallout instead
- Failure creates complications, not death
- Drama-focused mechanics
- Consequences drive story

**Resistance Play:**
- Players are revolutionaries
- Asymmetric power dynamics
- Stealth and social focus
- Political intrigue

**Minimal Prep:**
- GM creates in moment
- Player-driven content
- Collaborative worldbuilding
- Emergent stories

#### Key Content Design Lessons

**1. Failure-Forward Design**

Unlike D&D, Spire treats failure as content:
- Failed stealth = complications, not combat
- Failed persuasion = new problems, not dead end
- Failed action = stress, story continues
- Keeps narrative momentum

**2. Player-Generated Content**

Adventures structured around:
- Player goals (not GM plot)
- Player backstories (create scenarios)
- Player choices (drive direction)
- Player relationships (NPC dynamics)

**3. Modular Scenarios**

Published adventures are toolboxes:
- Location descriptions
- NPC sketches
- Situation templates
- Complication tables

GM assembles based on table needs.

**Applicability to BlueMarble:**
- Failure creates interesting outcomes (mining accident leads to discovery)
- Player-driven economy content
- Emergent scenarios from player interactions
- Stress-based systems (resource management pressure)

### Blades in the Dark

**Publisher:** Evil Hat Productions  
**Content Design Philosophy:** Heist structure, player agency

#### Content Approach

**Score Structure:**
- Players plan heist/job
- GM creates obstacles
- Flashback mechanics allow retroactive planning
- Consequences fuel next score

**Faction Game:**
- Multiple factions with goals
- Player actions affect faction standings
- Faction conflicts create content
- Emergent political landscape

**Minimal Prep, Maximum Impact:**
- GM creates during play
- Clocks track progress
- Complications from failed rolls
- Fiction-first gameplay

#### Key Content Design Lessons

**1. The Score Structure**

Heist Content Template:
```
1. Setup: Client offers job
2. Planning: Players choose approach (stealth, social, assault)
3. Execution: Play out score with obstacles
4. Consequences: Heat, harm, and rewards
5. Downtime: Resolve between-score activities
6. Repeat: New score emerges from consequences
```

This structure:
- Creates repeatable content framework
- Varies through player choices
- Generates emergent stories
- Maintains pacing

**2. Flashback Mechanics**

Players can declare:
- "Actually, I prepared for this earlier"
- Pay stress cost
- Retroactively establish preparation
- Keeps action moving forward

Solves "planning paralysis" problem while maintaining player agency.

**3. Complication as Content**

Failed rolls don't stop action:
- Generate complications (guards alerted)
- Create tough choices (escape or recover item?)
- Fuel future content (guild now hunts crew)
- Maintain momentum

**Applicability to BlueMarble:**
- Project structure for crafting/construction
- Faction systems for guilds
- Flashback-style planning (prepare infrastructure)
- Complications drive emergent economy

### Heart: The City Beneath

**Publisher:** Rowan, Rook and Decard  
**Content Design Philosophy:** Surreal exploration, delve structure

#### Content Approach

**Delve Structure:**
- Descending through layers
- Each layer has unique theme
- Resources become scarce deeper
- Risk/reward scaling

**Fallout System:**
- Damage creates narrative complications
- Physical, mental, social, and supply stress
- Fallout triggers story beats
- Failure enriches narrative

**Domain-Based Content:**
- Themed regions (The Hive, Drowned Quarters, etc.)
- Each domain has factions
- Environmental hazards
- Unique resources

#### Key Content Design Lessons

**1. Environmental Storytelling Zones**

Each Heart domain:
- Has distinct visual identity
- Represents different themes (decay, transformation, etc.)
- Contains appropriate factions
- Offers unique resources

Example: "The Hive"
- Theme: Insectoid transformation
- Factions: Vermissian Knights, Hive cultists
- Hazards: Mutating terrain
- Resources: Chitin, honey, silk

**2. Delve as Content Structure**

Exploration-focused content:
- Clear goal (reach deep location)
- Escalating danger
- Resource management
- Meaningful retreats

**3. Stress Tracks as Pacing**

Four stress types:
- **Blood**: Physical harm
- **Mind**: Mental trauma
- **Silver**: Financial loss
- **Supplies**: Resource depletion

Content designed to pressure different tracks, forcing choices.

**Applicability to BlueMarble:**
- Geological layers as domains
- Depth = difficulty/reward
- Multiple resource types
- Environmental hazards in deep mining

### Common Tabletop RPG Content Patterns
