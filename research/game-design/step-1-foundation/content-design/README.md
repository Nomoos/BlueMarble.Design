## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive research on content design in game development, broken into focused topic files for easier navigation and reference. The research explores content design as a discipline, analyzes approaches in major video game and tabletop RPGs, and synthesizes lessons applicable to BlueMarble's development.

**Total Research:** 12 topic files covering theory, practice, comparative analysis, and career guidance.

## Quick Start

**New to Content Design?** Start with these files in order:
1. [Content Design Overview](content-design-overview.md) - What it is and why it matters
2. [Content Design Workflow](content-design-workflow.md) - How the work gets done
3. [Content Designer Role](content-designer-role.md) - What content designers do

**Studying RPG Design?** Jump to:
- [Video Game RPGs](content-design-video-game-rpgs.md) - KCD, Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Gothic, BG3
- [Tabletop RPGs](content-design-tabletop-rpgs.md) - D&D, Dračí hlídka, Spire, Blades, Heart
- [Comparative Analysis](content-design-comparative-analysis.md) - Differences and commonalities

**Planning a Career?** Check out:
- [Essential Skills](content-designer-skills.md) - Beginner to advanced skills
- [Career Progression](content-designer-career.md) - Junior to Lead positions

**Implementing for BlueMarble?** See:
- [BlueMarble Applications](content-design-bluemarble.md) - Specific recommendations
- [Development Cycle Integration](content-design-in-development.md) - How content fits each phase
- [Content Rating Guidelines](../../../../docs/gameplay/content-rating-guidelines.md) - BlueMarble's content boundaries

**Important:** Many games analyzed in this research are M-rated (Mature 17+). BlueMarble targets Teen/PEGI 12 rating. We study these games for **content design techniques** (quest structure, player agency) while explicitly **NOT adopting mature content**. See [Content Rating Guidelines](../../../../docs/gameplay/content-rating-guidelines.md) for details.

## Key Findings Summary

**Content Design Fundamentals:**
- Content design bridges game mechanics, narrative, and player experience
- Creates player-facing experiences: quests, dialogue, tutorials, lore, UI text
- Requires writing, systems thinking, player psychology, and technical skills
- Integrates throughout the entire development cycle

**Video Game RPG Lessons:**
- Multiple solution paths encourage build diversity and replay value
- Skill-based content gating creates meaningful specialization
- Persistent consequences make choices feel meaningful
- Quality over quantity - handcrafted content with care
- Environmental storytelling between quests

**Tabletop RPG Lessons:**
- Framework-based content allows GM/player flexibility
- Player-driven goals create investment and ownership
- Failure-forward design maintains momentum and creates stories
- Emergent narratives from system interactions
- Low production cost enables rapid iteration

**BlueMarble Synthesis:**
- Use video game's systemic implementation for geological simulation
- Apply tabletop's framework approach for player-driven content
- Combine both for educational, emergent geological gameplay
- Leverage geological authenticity like KCD uses historical authenticity
- Enable community content creation like tabletop scenarios
