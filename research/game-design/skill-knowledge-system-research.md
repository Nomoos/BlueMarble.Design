            player.Skills[req.Key].CurrentLevel >= req.Value);
        
        if (!meetsRequirements)
            return false;
        
        // Discovery chance based on skill levels
        float discoveryChance = CalculateDiscoveryChance(player, node);
        float roll = Random.Next(0, 100);
        
        if (roll < discoveryChance)
        {
            UnlockKnowledge(player, node.KnowledgeId);
            AwardDiscoveryBonus(player, node);
            NotifyServer(player, node); // Other players can learn from
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private float CalculateDiscoveryChance(Player player, DiscoveryNode node)
    {
        // Higher skills = better chance
        float avgSkill = node.Requirements.Average(req => 
            player.Skills[req.Key].CurrentLevel);
        
        // Base chance increases with skill
        float baseChance = Math.Min(avgSkill, 90.0f);
        
        // Bonus for having teacher or research notes
        float knowledgeBonus = player.HasAccessToResearch(node) ? 20.0f : 0.0f;
