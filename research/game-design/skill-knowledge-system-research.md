```

#### Skill Acquisition

**Primary Mechanism: Learn-By-Doing**

Skills automatically unlock and improve through use:

```
Skill Gain Flow:
1. Player performs action (e.g., mines iron ore)
2. Game checks if skill exists:
   - If NO: Skill unlocked at level 0
   - If YES: Continue to progression
3. Calculate experience gain:
   - Base gain = Action complexity
   - Difficulty modifier = Material/task difficulty vs skill
   - Knowledge bonus = Related knowledge unlocked
   - Tool quality = Equipment effectiveness
4. Apply experience to skill
5. Skill level increases when threshold reached
6. New capabilities unlock at milestone levels

Example: Mining Iron Ore
- First attempt: Mining skill unlocked (0 → 1)
- Success chance: 30% (low skill, basic tools)
- Gain: 0.5 exp per attempt
- At level 10: 60% success, 0.3 exp (diminishing returns)
- At level 50: 95% success, 0.1 exp, unlock advanced techniques
- At level 100: 99% success, 0.01 exp, master-level efficiency
```

**Knowledge Discovery System:**

Knowledge is discovered through experimentation and analysis:

```
Knowledge Discovery Paths:

1. Geological Analysis
   Player examines rock formation
   → Reveals basic composition
   → Identifies formation type (sedimentary/igneous/metamorphic)
   → Unlocks knowledge: "Granite Formation Characteristics"
   → Bonus: +10% efficiency mining granite

2. Experimentation
   Player combines copper + tin in furnace
   → Creates bronze (discovery)
   → Unlocks knowledge: "Bronze Alloying"
   → Recipe permanently learned
   → Bonus: +5% bronze quality

3. Tool Usage
   Player uses pickaxe on various rocks
   → Learns tool effectiveness patterns
   → Unlocks knowledge: "Tool-Rock Interaction"
   → Bonus: Better tool selection guidance

4. Environmental Observation
   Player explores different biomes
   → Identifies geological patterns
   → Unlocks knowledge: "Resource Distribution"
   → Bonus: Improved surveying predictions
```

#### Progression Mechanics

**Use-Based Skill Improvement:**

Similar to Wurm Online, skills improve through practice:

```
Progression Formula:
skill_gain = base_gain × difficulty_match × knowledge_bonus × tool_factor

Where:
- base_gain: 0.01 to 1.0 depending on action
- difficulty_match: Highest when task matches skill level
  - Too easy: 0.3× multiplier
  - Just right: 1.0× multiplier
  - Too hard: 0.5× multiplier
- knowledge_bonus: 1.0 + (relevant_knowledge × 0.02)
  - Max 2.0× with extensive knowledge
- tool_factor: 0.5 (poor tools) to 1.5× (excellent tools)

Skill Curve (hours to reach level):
Level 0-20:   5-10 hours (rapid early gains)
Level 20-40:  15-25 hours (moderate progression)
Level 40-60:  30-50 hours (slowing down)
Level 60-80:  60-100 hours (specialist territory)
Level 80-100: 100-200 hours (mastery)

Total to 100: 250-400 hours of focused practice
```

**Knowledge Points System:**

Players earn knowledge points through discoveries:

```
Knowledge Point Sources:
- First-time material discovery: 10-50 points
- New geological formation: 25-100 points
- Recipe experimentation success: 15-30 points
- Technology milestone: 50-200 points
- Teaching others: 5-10 points per student
- Exploration discoveries: 20-75 points

Knowledge Point Usage:
- Unlock research projects: 100-500 points
- Accelerate skill training: 50 points = 10% boost for 1 hour
- Purchase knowledge books: 200-1000 points
- Unlock specializations: 300-800 points

#### Integration with Game Systems

**Skill-Gathering Integration:**

```
Mining Integration Flow:

1. Player locates deposit
   → Requires: Surveying skill + Geology knowledge
   → Higher skill: Better deposit assessment
   → Knowledge: Identify ore type and quality

2. Player attempts extraction
   → Requires: Mining skill + Appropriate tool
   → Higher skill: Better success rate
   → Knowledge: Optimal extraction method

3. Success/Failure determination
   Formula:
   success_chance = base_rate × skill_factor × tool_factor × knowledge_factor
   
   Where:
   - base_rate: 0.3 (30% base for appropriate tool)
   - skill_factor: 1.0 + (mining_skill / 100)
     → At skill 0: 1.0× (30% success)
     → At skill 50: 1.5× (45% success)
     → At skill 100: 2.0× (60% success)
   - tool_factor: 0.5 (wrong tool) to 1.5× (optimal tool)
   - knowledge_factor: 1.0 + (relevant_knowledge × 0.05)
     → With 10 knowledge items: 1.5× bonus

4. Material quality calculation
   extracted_quality = deposit_quality × skill_bonus × knowledge_bonus
   
   Where:
   - deposit_quality: Geological base (Q40-Q90)
   - skill_bonus: 0.7 + (skill / 333) → 0.7× to 1.0× at skill 100
   - knowledge_bonus: 1.0 + (knowledge / 100) → up to 1.2× bonus

Example: Iron Ore Extraction
   Deposit: Q70 hematite
   Player: Mining 60, 5 knowledge items
   Tool: Steel pickaxe (optimal)
   
   Success: 30% × 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.25 = 90% chance
   Quality: Q70 × 0.88 × 1.05 = Q64.7 extracted
```

**Skill-Crafting Integration:**

```
Crafting Integration Flow:

1. Player selects recipe
   → Requires: Recipe knowledge (discovered or taught)
   → Technology: Era-appropriate unlocked
   → Materials: Required inputs available

2. Crafting attempt
   → Requires: Relevant crafting skill
   → Facility: Appropriate workstation
   → Tools: Necessary equipment

3. Success determination
   success_chance = base_rate × skill_factor × material_factor × facility_factor
   
   Where:
   - base_rate: Recipe difficulty (0.4-0.8)
   - skill_factor: 0.5 + (skill / 100) → 0.5× to 1.5×
   - material_factor: avg_material_quality / 100
   - facility_factor: 0.8 (basic) to 1.2× (advanced)

4. Output quality
   output_quality = base × materials × skill × knowledge
   
   Where:
   - base: Recipe base quality (Q50-Q70)
   - materials: (material_quality_avg / 100) → 0.4× to 1.0×
   - skill: 0.6 + (skill / 250) → 0.6× to 1.0×
   - knowledge: 1.0 + (recipe_mastery / 50) → 1.0× to 1.2×

Example: Bronze Tool Crafting
   Recipe: Bronze Pickaxe (base Q60)
   Player: Crafting 75, Recipe mastery 8
   Materials: Copper Q80, Tin Q85 (avg Q82.5)
   Facility: Advanced forge (1.1×)
   
   Success: 60% × 1.25 × 0.825 × 1.1 = 68% chance
   Quality: Q60 × 0.825 × 0.9 × 1.16 = Q51.6 result
```

**Skill-Combat Integration:**

```
Combat Integration (Limited):

Novus Inceptio has minimal combat, but skills affect it:

1. Tool Effectiveness as Weapons
   → Mining skill: Better pickaxe control → weapon damage
   → Crafting skill: Higher quality tools → durability in combat
   → Knowledge: Material properties → tactical advantages

2. Armor and Protection
   → Smelting skill: Better metal quality → armor effectiveness
   → Engineering: Structure building → defensive positions
   → Material science: Damage resistance properties

3. Indirect Combat Advantages
   → Resource control: Better extractors control territories
   → Economic power: Trading skill enables mercenary hiring
   → Technology: Advanced tools/weapons unlock earlier

Note: Combat is NOT the primary focus; skills are primarily
economic and productive, not military.
```

**Skill-Exploration Integration:**

```
Exploration Integration Flow:

1. Territory Discovery
   → No requirements: Anyone can explore
   → Surveying skill: Better map information
   → Geology knowledge: Resource hints on map

2. Resource Identification
   → Visual inspection: Basic (all players)
   → Geological analysis: Requires knowledge
   → Advanced testing: Requires equipment + skill

3. Environmental Hazards
   → Basic awareness: Universal
   → Hazard assessment: Requires geology knowledge
   → Risk mitigation: Engineering + planning skills

4. Strategic Mapping
   → Basic map: Shows terrain
   → Surveyor map: Shows resource indicators
   → Master map: Predictive geological modeling

Example: Resource Surveying
   Low skill (0-30):
   - "There might be ore here" (vague)
   - Random prospecting required
   - High failure rate
   
   Medium skill (30-70):
   - "Iron ore deposit likely" (specific)
   - Targeted prospecting
   - Moderate success rate
   
   High skill (70-100):
   - "Hematite deposit, Q70-Q85, 500-800 units" (precise)
   - Direct extraction
   - High success rate
   - Extent mapping

{
    public float CalculateGain(PlayerSkills player, SkillType skill, 
                               float actionDifficulty, bool hasTeacher)
    {
        float currentLevel = player.Skills[skill].CurrentLevel;
        float baseDifficulty = actionDifficulty;
        
        // Early gains are fast, late gains slow
        float progressionCurve = 1.0f / (1.0f + currentLevel / 10.0f);
        
        // Difficulty matching: Too easy or hard = less gain
        float difficultyMatch = CalculateDifficultyMatch(currentLevel, 
                                                          baseDifficulty);
        
        // Teacher bonus
        float teacherBonus = hasTeacher ? 1.5f : 1.0f;
        
        // Parent skill bonus
        float parentBonus = GetParentSkillBonus(player, skill);
        
        float totalGain = progressionCurve * difficultyMatch * 
                          teacherBonus * parentBonus * BaseGainRate;
        
        return totalGain;
    }
    
    private float CalculateDifficultyMatch(float skill, float difficulty)
    {
        // Optimal: Difficulty = Skill ± 10
        float difference = Math.Abs(skill - difficulty);
        if (difference < 10) return 1.0f;
        if (difference < 20) return 0.5f;
        if (difference < 30) return 0.25f;
        return 0.1f; // Too easy or too hard
    }
}
```

**Knowledge Discovery System:**
```csharp
public class KnowledgeDiscoverySystem
{
    public bool AttemptDiscovery(Player player, DiscoveryNode node)
    {
        // Check skill requirements
        bool meetsRequirements = node.Requirements.All(req => 
            player.Skills[req.Key].CurrentLevel >= req.Value);
        
        if (!meetsRequirements)
            return false;
        
        // Discovery chance based on skill levels
        float discoveryChance = CalculateDiscoveryChance(player, node);
        float roll = Random.Next(0, 100);
        
        if (roll < discoveryChance)
        {
            UnlockKnowledge(player, node.KnowledgeId);
            AwardDiscoveryBonus(player, node);
            NotifyServer(player, node); // Other players can learn from
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private float CalculateDiscoveryChance(Player player, DiscoveryNode node)
    {
        // Higher skills = better chance
        float avgSkill = node.Requirements.Average(req => 
            player.Skills[req.Key].CurrentLevel);
        
        // Base chance increases with skill
        float baseChance = Math.Min(avgSkill, 90.0f);
        
        // Bonus for having teacher or research notes
        float knowledgeBonus = player.HasAccessToResearch(node) ? 20.0f : 0.0f;
        
        return Math.Min(baseChance + knowledgeBonus, 95.0f);
    }
}
```
