## Part 1: Physics, AI & Simulation - Research Analysis

### 1.1 Physics System Architecture Patterns

#### Chunk-Based Physics Architecture

**Concept**: Divide the world into independent physics regions to manage computational complexity.

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Region Size Selection**
   - **Small regions (1-5 km)**: Lower computational load per region, more frequent handoffs
   - **Large regions (10-50 km)**: Fewer handoffs, higher computational requirements
   - **Trade-off**: Balance between handoff complexity and physics engine performance
   - **Research Finding**: 5-10 km regions optimal for most scenarios (based on WoW, EVE Online analysis)

2. **Physics Update Frequency**
   - **High-fidelity zones** (player interaction areas): 60-120 Hz
   - **Mid-fidelity zones** (visible but distant): 30 Hz
   - **Low-fidelity zones** (simulation-only): 10 Hz
   - **Dormant zones** (no players): 1 Hz or paused
   - **Research**: Adaptive frequency based on player density shows 40% CPU reduction

3. **Boundary Transition Strategies**
   - **Hard boundaries**: Instant teleport with state serialization
   - **Soft boundaries**: Overlapping regions with gradual handoff
   - **Predictive pre-loading**: Load destination physics world in advance
   - **Research consensus**: Soft boundaries with 100m overlap provide seamless experience

**Architectural Patterns**:

- **Pattern 1: Regional Physics Worlds**
  - Multiple independent physics simulations
  - Each region is self-contained
  - Cross-region interactions handled at boundaries
  - Pros: Scalability, parallelization, fault isolation
  - Cons: Complex boundary handling, synchronization overhead

- **Pattern 2: Hierarchical Physics LOD**
  - Full physics near players
  - Simplified physics at distance
  - Statistical approximation for far objects
  - Pros: Performance optimization, smooth degradation
  - Cons: Consistency challenges, determinism issues

- **Pattern 3: Sparse Simulation**
  - Only simulate objects with forces acting on them
  - Static objects remain inactive
  - Wake/sleep system for efficiency
  - Pros: Massive performance improvement
  - Cons: Requires careful wake condition design

#### Origin Shifting for Physics

**Research Findings**:

- Most physics engines (PhysX, Bullet, Jolt) use 32-bit floats internally
- Precision degradation begins at ~10km from origin
- Origin shifting required every 5-10km of player movement
- Shift duration: 1-5ms depending on object count
- Object velocity/momentum unaffected by shift (relative motion)

**Design Patterns**:

1. **Synchronous Shift**: Pause simulation, shift all objects, resume
   - Simple to implement
   - Causes brief (1-5ms) physics freeze
   - Acceptable for most games

2. **Asynchronous Shift**: Gradual shift over multiple frames
   - No visible pause
   - Complex state management
   - Risk of temporary inconsistencies

3. **Predictive Shift**: Shift before player reaches threshold
   - Smoothest experience
   - Requires accurate player movement prediction
   - Can waste shifts if prediction wrong

**Research Recommendation**: Synchronous shift with 5km threshold for most scenarios.

### 1.2 AI & Navigation Research

#### Hierarchical Pathfinding Architecture

**Three-Level Hierarchy** (based on Cities: Skylines analysis):

1. **Global Level**: Continent/region navigation
   - Graph-based pathfinding on major waypoints
   - Pre-computed shortest paths
   - Update frequency: Static or daily
   - Research: A* on 10,000-node graph = 10-50ms

2. **Regional Level**: Local area navigation
   - Navmesh-based pathfinding
   - Dynamic obstacle avoidance
   - Update frequency: Per-request
   - Research: A* on navmesh = 1-5ms

3. **Local Level**: Immediate movement
   - Steering behaviors
   - Collision avoidance
   - Update frequency: Every frame
   - Research: Local avoidance = 0.1-0.5ms per agent

**Architectural Trade-offs**:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Pure Navmesh** | Accurate, flexible | Memory intensive, slow updates | Small worlds (<10 km²) |
| **Pure Waypoint** | Fast, scalable | Inflexible, unnatural paths | Large worlds, strategic AI |
| **Hierarchical** | Balanced, scalable | Complex to implement | Planet-scale worlds ✓ |
| **Flow Fields** | Many agents efficiently | Poor for individual paths | Crowds, swarms |

**Research Insights**:

- Flow fields excel for 100+ agents moving to same goal (RTS games)
- Hierarchical pathfinding scales to planet-size worlds
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance should be local-only (performance)
- Pre-computed paths for common routes reduce CPU by 70%

#### AI State Management at Scale

**Dormancy Patterns**:

1. **Full Dormancy**: AI completely inactive when no players nearby
   - CPU savings: 95%
   - Wake-up time: 1-10 frames
   - Risk: Noticeable AI "pop-in"

2. **Statistical Simulation**: Simplified state updates for distant AI
   - CPU savings: 80%
   - Maintains world consistency
   - No visible pop-in

3. **Partial Dormancy**: Reduce update frequency for distant AI
   - CPU savings: 50-70%
   - Gradual quality degradation
   - Smoothest transition

**Research Finding**: MMO games use combination of all three:
- Full dormancy for areas with no players (0+ km)
- Statistical simulation for far areas (1-5 km)
- Partial dormancy for visible areas (200m-1km)
- Full simulation for nearby (0-200m)

### 1.3 Procedural & Dynamic Terrain

**Architectural Considerations**:

1. **Real-time Terrain Modification**
   - Voxel editing: Immediate update to voxel array
   - Mesh regeneration: Async on worker threads (16-100ms)
   - Collision update: After mesh generation (1-5ms)
   - Network sync: Delta updates only (changed voxels)

2. **Octree Index Rebuild**
   - Full rebuild: 50-500ms for large regions (unacceptable)
   - Incremental update: 5-20ms (acceptable)
   - Lazy rebuild: Defer until query (optimal for sparse modifications)
   - Research: Lazy rebuild reduces overhead by 90%

3. **Persistence Strategy**
   - Write-through: Immediate save to storage (high I/O)
   - Write-back: Batch saves every N seconds (risk of data loss)
   - Write-ahead logging: Log changes, batch apply (safe + efficient)
   - Research consensus: WAL with 30-second flush optimal

**Design Pattern: Modification Queue**

```
Player modifies voxel
  ↓
Queue modification (instant)
  ↓
Async worker:
  1. Update voxel array (1ms)
  2. Mark chunk dirty (instant)
  3. Queue mesh rebuild (async)
  ↓

  1. Generate mesh (16-100ms)
  2. Upload to GPU (1-5ms)
  ↓

  1. Regenerate collision (5-20ms)
  ↓
Network sync:
  1. Send delta to nearby players (1-10ms)
  ↓
Persistence:
  1. Write to WAL (instant)
  2. Batch flush to storage (30s)
```

## Part 2: Networking & Multi-Layer Synchronization - Research Analysis

### 2.1 Region-Based Sharding Patterns

**Sharding Architectures**:

#### Static Geographic Sharding

**Design**:
- World divided into fixed-size regions (e.g., 1000km × 1000km)
- Each region assigned to dedicated server
- Players connect to server for their current region

**Analysis**:
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable, easy to debug
- **Cons**: Uneven load distribution, hot-spot issues
- **Used by**: Most traditional MMOs (WoW, EVE pre-2010)

#### Dynamic Load-Based Sharding

**Design**:
- Region boundaries adjust based on player density
- High-density areas split into smaller shards
- Low-density areas merge into larger shards

**Analysis**:
- **Pros**: Optimal resource utilization, handles hot-spots
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, frequent migrations
- **Research**: Can improve capacity by 3-5x in uneven distributions

#### Hybrid Sharding

**Design**:

- Suitable for: Uniform player distribution
- Memory: ~100 bytes per cell
- Research: 92% bandwidth reduction vs. no filtering

#### Quad-Tree AOI

**Design**: Hierarchical spatial partitioning, adapts to density

**Performance Analysis**:
- Update cost: O(log n) for query
- Suitable for: Non-uniform distribution
- Memory: Variable, ~200 bytes per node
- Research: 95% bandwidth reduction, but 2x CPU cost

#### Hybrid AOI (Grid + Quad-Tree)

**Design**: Grid for dynamic entities, quad-tree for static objects

**Performance Analysis**:
- Best of both worlds
- 94% bandwidth reduction
- Moderate CPU cost
- Research Recommendation: Optimal for most scenarios

**Vertical/Layered LOD Research**:

- **Concept**: Different update frequencies for different altitudes
- **Surface layer** (±100m): 20 Hz updates
- **Sky layer** (100m-10km): 5 Hz updates
- **Space layer** (>10km): 1 Hz updates
- **Underground** (<-100m): 10 Hz updates
- **Research**: 60% reduction in network traffic for vertically-distributed players

### 2.3 Cross-Region Effects & Consistency

**Cell Tower Handoff Model**:

**Phases**:
1. **Pre-warming**: Destination server loads player state (500-2000ms)
2. **Overlap**: Player in both regions (100-500ms)
3. **Handoff**: Primary region switches (instant)
4. **Cleanup**: Source region releases state (1000-5000ms)

**Research Findings**:
- Pre-warming reduces perceived latency to near-zero
- Overlap period critical for seamless experience
- 200ms overlap optimal (too short = glitches, too long = overhead)
- Failed handoffs require rollback (rare but must handle)

**Consistency Models**:

#### Strong Consistency

**Design**: All updates must be confirmed across regions

**Analysis**:
- Latency: High (50-500ms cross-region)
- Correctness: Perfect
- Use case: Financial transactions, critical gameplay
- Research: Only 5-10% of events need strong consistency

#### Eventual Consistency

**Design**: Updates propagate asynchronously

**Analysis**:
- Latency: Low (1-5ms local)
- Correctness: Temporary divergence
- Use case: Non-critical visual updates
- Research: 90% of events can use eventual consistency

#### Causal Consistency

**Design**: Maintains cause-effect relationships

**Analysis**:
- Latency: Moderate (10-50ms)
- Correctness: Logically consistent
- Use case: Chat, combat, most gameplay
- Research: Sweet spot for most MMO systems

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach with consistency levels per event type.

### 2.4 Weather & Day-Night Synchronization

**Synchronization Patterns**:

1. **Timestamped Deltas**
   - Each update has global timestamp
   - Clients interpolate between updates
   - Handles network jitter gracefully
   - Research: Standard approach for MMO time-of-day

2. **Synchronized Clock**
   - All servers maintain synchronized time (NTP)
   - Weather/time calculated deterministically
   - No explicit synchronization needed
   - Research: Most efficient, requires good clock sync

3. **Event-Driven Updates**
   - Major changes broadcast as events
   - Minor changes calculated locally
   - Optimal bandwidth usage
   - Research: Used for dynamic weather systems

**Weather System Architecture**:

- **Global layer**: Planet-scale patterns (pressure systems, jet streams)
  - Update frequency: 1 Hz
  - Propagation: Eventual consistency
  - Storage: Sparse grid (100km resolution)

- **Regional layer**: Local weather (clouds, precipitation)
  - Update frequency: 5 Hz
  - Propagation: Causal consistency
  - Storage: Dense grid (1km resolution)

- **Local layer**: Immediate effects (rain particles, wind)
  - Update frequency: 30-60 Hz
