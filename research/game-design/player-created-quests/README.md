# Player-Created Quest Systems Research

This directory contains research on how resource-gathering players (farmers, crafters) design and implement quest systems to outsource grind tasks to other players.

## Research Steps Overview

This research is organized in a step-by-step structure for clear progression:

1. **[Step 1: Quest System Patterns](step-1-quest-system-patterns/)** - Analysis of player-created quest mechanisms across MMORPGs
2. **[Step 2: Resource Request Design](step-2-resource-request-design/)** - How players structure resource gathering quests
3. **[Step 3: Incentive Structures](step-3-incentive-structures/)** - Reward systems and economic integration
4. **[Step 4: BlueMarble Implementation](step-4-bluemarble-implementation/)** - Integration recommendations for BlueMarble

Each step contains detailed research documents and can be explored independently or sequentially.

## Overview

Player-created quest systems enable resource-gathering players (farmers, crafters, builders) to outsource tedious grinding tasks to other players through structured request systems. These systems create emergent gameplay loops where:

- **Crafters** create quests requesting raw materials they need for production
- **Gatherers** complete quests to earn rewards and reputation
- **Economy** benefits from structured trade and specialization
- **Community** develops through cooperative task completion

This research examines how successful MMORPGs implement player-created quest systems, focusing on:
- Quest creation interfaces and design patterns
- Resource specification and quality requirements
- Reward structures and economic balance
- Social systems (reputation, guilds, contracts)
- Anti-exploitation measures
- Integration with crafting and gathering systems

## Key Research Questions

1. How do players create and publish quests for other players to complete?
2. What design patterns make resource-gathering quests appealing to both requesters and completers?
3. How do games balance quest rewards to maintain economic health?
4. What mechanisms prevent exploitation and maintain quest quality?
5. How do player-created quests integrate with skill progression and specialization systems?
6. What role do guilds, factions, and reputation systems play in quest ecosystems?

## Contents

### Step 1: Quest System Patterns
Analysis of player-created quest mechanisms including:
- Bounty boards and work order systems
- Contract creation interfaces
- Quest discovery and matchmaking
- Quest types and templates

### Step 2: Resource Request Design
How players structure resource gathering requests:
- Material specification (type, quality, quantity)
- Delivery conditions and timeframes
- Partial completion and batch processing
- Quality control and acceptance criteria

### Step 3: Incentive Structures
Reward systems that drive quest completion:
- Currency-based rewards
- Reputation and standing systems
- Material exchange and barter
- Skill progression integration
- Guild benefits and collective rewards

### Step 4: BlueMarble Implementation
Integration recommendations including:
- Geological resource quest patterns
- Knowledge-based quest gating
- Multi-stage processing chain quests
- Terraforming project coordination
- Educational quest design

## Research Philosophy

### Player Agency Through Cooperation
Players should be able to create quests that meaningfully advance their goals while providing engaging content for others.

### Economic Integration
Quest systems must enhance rather than disrupt player-driven economies, creating sustainable trade loops.

### Specialization Support
Quest systems should encourage specialization by enabling efficient resource exchange between specialists.

### Anti-Grinding Design
While quests involve repetitive tasks, they should provide structure, purpose, and social connection that transforms grinding into meaningful gameplay.

## Integration with BlueMarble

Player-created quest systems align perfectly with BlueMarble's design goals:

### Geological Specialization
- **Miners** post quests for specific ore qualities from particular geological formations
- **Metallurgists** request processed materials with specific purity requirements
- **Builders** commission material gathering for large construction projects
- **Researchers** offer rewards for geological survey data from remote locations

### Knowledge Economy
- Quest completion can reward geological knowledge and discoveries
- Advanced quests require understanding of geological processes
- Quest chains teach complex geological concepts through structured progression

### Collaborative Terraforming
- Large-scale geological projects require coordinated resource gathering
- Guild quest systems for continental-scale engineering
- Community goals for environmental transformation

### Educational Value
- Quests introduce players to geological concepts through practical application
- Resource specifications teach material properties and quality factors
- Multi-stage quests demonstrate geological processing chains
- Discovery quests encourage exploration and geological investigation

## Real-World Examples

Games with notable player-created quest/work order systems:
- **EVE Online**: Contract system for item delivery, courier missions, and manufacturing
- **Star Wars Galaxies**: Bounty hunter system and crafter work orders
- **Final Fantasy XIV**: Crafting collectables and custom delivery requests
- **Albion Online**: Island worker tasks and guild requisitions
- **World of Warcraft**: Work orders for crafting professions
- **Wurm Online**: Player-created bounties and requests
- **Life is Feudal**: Guild work orders and production chains
- **Eco Global Survival**: Government work projects and collaborative research

## Research Methodology

This research employs multiple approaches:

1. **System Analysis**: Examination of existing implementations in leading MMORPGs
2. **Design Pattern Extraction**: Identification of common patterns and best practices
3. **Economic Modeling**: Analysis of reward structures and economic impacts
4. **Player Psychology**: Understanding motivations for quest creation and completion
5. **Anti-Exploitation Review**: Security and fairness mechanisms
6. **Educational Integration**: Adapting systems for BlueMarble's educational goals

## Contributing

When adding to this research:

1. Follow the step-by-step organizational structure
2. Include concrete examples from actual games
3. Analyze both successes and failures
4. Consider economic and social implications
5. Provide actionable recommendations for BlueMarble
6. Cross-reference with existing skill, crafting, and material research

## Summary

Player-created quest systems transform resource grinding from a solitary chore into a social, economic activity that drives specialization and cooperation. When well-designed, these systems:

- Create structured content from player needs
- Enable efficient resource exchange between specialists
- Build community through cooperative task completion
- Support economic health through predictable supply and demand
- Provide progression paths for both crafters and gatherers
- Generate emergent gameplay from player creativity

For BlueMarble, player-created quest systems offer a powerful mechanism to support geological specialization, encourage knowledge sharing, enable collaborative terraforming, and maintain the project's educational mission while creating engaging gameplay.
