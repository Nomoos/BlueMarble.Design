This directory contains annotated screenshots from Vintage Story demonstrating the skill and knowledge progression systems analyzed in the [Vintage Story Skill and Knowledge System Research](../../vintage-story-skill-knowledge-system-research.md) document.

## Screenshot Index

### Skills Interface Screenshots

**Screenshot 1: Skills Tab - Active and Passive Skills (Part 1)**
- **Source URL:** https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea86940f-ed9b-42b1-8b26-6845ba16e859
- **Description:** Shows the skills interface with active skills bar (Climbing, Botanizing, Fishing, Foraging) and passive skills list including Defensive Fighting, Firemaking, Hammers, Healing, and First Aid
- **Key Elements:**
  - Active skills bar at top with 4 assigned skills
  - Passive skills with progress dots showing level progression
  - Numerical skill levels (1.00 base level)
  - Skill descriptions and attribute bonuses (Speed+, PSY STR+, etc.)
  - "Add to Skill Bar" and "Already assigned" status indicators
- **Important Note:** This appears to be from a modded version, as vanilla Vintage Story uses implicit progression

**Screenshot 2: Skills Tab - Extended Skills List (Part 2)**
- **Source URL:** https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb99dc7-9d86-4b89-89c0-f11459827840
- **Description:** Continuation of skills interface showing additional skills including Hi-Tech Items, Knives, Leatherworking, and Masonry
- **Key Elements:**
  - Extended skills list with progression indicators
  - Attribute bonus columns (STRENGTH+, STAMINA+, CONTROL+, LOGIC+, SPEED+, PSY STR+, PSY DEPTH+)
  - Visual progression dots for each skill
  - Assignment status for each skill
- **Important Note:** Demonstrates modding potential - base game doesn't have explicit skill levels

## Annotations and Analysis

### UI/UX Design Observations

**Clean, Minimalist Interface:**
- Dark background reduces eye strain during extended play
- Blue highlights for interactive elements and selected tabs
- Clear categorization (Active Skills vs. Passive Skills)
- Consistent iconography for skills

**Visual Progress Indicators:**
- Dot progression system (9 visible levels per skill)
- Numerical display (1.00 = base level)
- Green checkmarks indicate active bonuses
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Skill Assignment System:**
- Limited active skill slots (promotes meaningful choice)
- Clear feedback on assignment status
- Easy to understand action buttons
- Prevents accidental changes

### Comparison to Vanilla Vintage Story

**Vanilla Game (No Explicit Skills):**
- No skill points or experience bars
- No numerical skill levels
- Progression through knowledge and tool access
- Handbook system as primary progression indicator
- Implicit mastery through player understanding

**Modded Version (Shown in Screenshots):**
- Explicit skill levels with progression
- Stat bonuses from skill advancement
- Active/passive skill categorization
- Traditional MMORPG-style interface

### Implications for BlueMarble Design

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Modding Flexibility:**
   - Vintage Story's architecture supports both implicit and explicit progression
   - Community adds traditional skill systems via mods
   - Demonstrates demand for visible progression metrics

2. **Design Options:**
   - BlueMarble could offer both systems
   - Implicit for core gameplay (knowledge-driven)
   - Optional explicit tracking for players who want metrics
   - Best of both approaches

3. **UI/UX Lessons:**
   - Clean, readable interface essential
   - Visual progress indicators valued by players
   - Clear categorization helps organization
   - Minimal clutter maintains focus

4. **Player Psychology:**
   - Some players need visible metrics for satisfaction
   - Others prefer immersive implicit systems
   - Offering choice maximizes audience
   - No "one size fits all" solution

## Additional Screenshot Needs

For comprehensive research, additional screenshots would be valuable:

### Vanilla Vintage Story Screenshots Needed:
- [ ] Handbook interface showing knowledge entries
- [ ] Crafting grid with recipe discovery
- [ ] Tool quality indicators
- [ ] Material quality display
- [ ] Technology progression examples (stone → copper → bronze → iron)
- [ ] Geological prospecting interface
- [ ] Temporal storm mechanics

### Comparative Screenshots Needed:
- [ ] Other MMORPGs' skill interfaces for comparison
- [ ] Eco Global Survival skill books system
- [ ] Wurm Online skill progression
- [ ] Traditional class-based systems
