## Executive Summary

Heart: The City Beneath is a tabletop RPG set in a surreal, hostile underground environment beneath the dark elf city of Spire. It is a distinct but thematically related setting to Spire, focusing on delving, body horror, and inevitable doom. This knowledge package catalogs the game's geography, metaphysics, mechanical systems, and thematic elements, making it suitable for worldbuilding references, horror writing inspiration, and cross-pollination with other mythos (especially Lovecraftian horror).

Heart uses an updated version of the Resistance System to create narratively high-stakes scenarios where player characters pursue dangerous ambitions while managing escalating stress and fallout. The game's mechanics deeply reinforce its themes of transformation, risk, and the cost of power in a reality-warping dungeon.

## Geography and Metaphysics of the City Beneath

### The Nature of the Heart

The Heart is not simply an underground cavern systemâ€”it is a **living, hostile, reality-warping dungeon** that exists beneath the drow city of Spire. It is described as:

- **A Malevolent Entity**: The Heart itself is sentient and actively hostile to intruders, warping space, time, and flesh
- **Infinite and Contradictory**: The Heart's geography is inconsistent and impossible, with locations that defy Euclidean geometry
- **Transformative**: Prolonged exposure to the Heart changes people physically, mentally, and spiritually
- **Ancient and Unknowable**: The Heart predates Spire and even drow civilization, with origins lost to time

### Vertical Structure

The Heart is organized into **tiers** that represent both physical depth and narrative progression:

1. **The Borderlands** (Surface Tier): The transition zone between Spire and the deep Heart, including:
   - The Vermissian (corrupted mass transit system)
   - Briar (parasitic forest)
   - The Drowned Quarters (flooded ruins)

2. **The Mid-Heart**: Stranger, more hostile regions where reality becomes increasingly unstable:
   - Derelictus (city of outcasts)
   - The Hive (insectoid nightmare)
   - The Gutter (vertical slum)

3. **The Deep Heart**: Nearly incomprehensible zones where few return:
   - Haven (paradoxical refuge)
   - The Sanctum (cult stronghold)
   - The Sinking Plain (reality-eroding wasteland)

### Metaphysical Properties

- **Non-Euclidean Geography**: Distances are subjective; the same journey may take hours or weeks
- **Temporal Distortion**: Time flows differently in different parts of the Heart
- **Reality Erosion**: The deeper you go, the less reliable physical laws become
- **Transformation Field**: The Heart actively mutates living things, especially those who delve repeatedly
- **Memory and Identity**: The Heart can affect memories, creating false histories or erasing true ones

### Access Points

The Heart can be entered through various points in Spire:

- **The Vermissian Network**: Abandoned subway tunnels that penetrate deep underground
- **Cracks and Rifts**: Spontaneous tears in reality that appear throughout Spire
- **Ancient Passages**: Pre-existing tunnels from before Spire's founding
- **Ritual Gateways**: Magical portals created by desperate or ambitious individuals

## Recurring Locations, Entities, and Phenomena

## Themes: Risk, Transformation, Doom, and Surrealism

### Risk and Consequences

Heart is fundamentally about **accepting terrible costs** to achieve important goals:

- **No Safe Delves**: Every journey into the Heart risks permanent harm
- **Escalating Stakes**: Problems compound rather than resolve cleanly
- **Meaningful Choices**: Players choose what to risk (body, mind, relationships, sanity)
- **No Going Back**: Consequences are permanent; there is no "reset button"

**Mechanical Expression**: The stress and fallout system ensures that every action has potential costs, and those costs accumulate over time.

### Transformation

Physical, mental, and spiritual **change is inevitable** in Heart:

- **Body Horror**: Characters develop mutations, scars, and inhuman features
- **Identity Erosion**: Prolonged exposure alters personality and memory
- **Power Through Change**: Abilities often come from accepting transformation
- **No Pure Heroes**: Everyone who delves becomes monstrous in some way

**Mechanical Expression**: Fallout permanently alters characters, and many classes have abilities that require accepting physical or mental changes.

### Inevitable Doom

Characters in Heart are marked for **death or worse**:

- **The Question is When, Not If**: Characters will fall; the game is about what they accomplish first
- **Final Beats**: The concept that everyone's story ends in the Heart, one way or another
- **Legacy Over Survival**: Success is measured by impact, not longevity
- **Acceptance**: The most powerful characters embrace their doom rather than flee from it

**Mechanical Expression**: The game has no death saves; when you're done, you're done. But your final act can matter enormously.

### Surrealism

Heart revels in **impossible, dreamlike horror**:

- **Logic is Optional**: The Heart doesn't follow natural laws
- **Symbolic Reality**: Locations and entities represent psychological or philosophical concepts
- **Grotesque Beauty**: Horror and wonder intertwine
- **Subjective Experience**: Different people experience the Heart differently

**Mechanical Expression**: GMs are encouraged to describe events in symbolic, metaphorical terms rather than literal physics.

## The Resistance System and Narrative Stakes

### Core Mechanics

Heart uses an evolution of the **Resistance System** from Spire, which emphasizes:

1. **Resistance Rolls**: d10 pool against difficulty, highest die counts
2. **Domains and Skills**: Broad categories (Compel, Delve, Discern, Endure, Evade, Hunt, Kill, Mend, Sneak) rather than granular skills
3. **Stress and Protection**: Damage is abstract (stress) and resisted by skills/equipment
4. **Fallout**: Accumulated stress triggers permanent consequences

### Key Innovations for Heart

#### Revised Stress Types

Heart uses **five stress tracks** corresponding to different types of harm:

1. **Blood** (physical injury): Bleeding, broken bones, exhaustion
2. **Mind** (psychological trauma): Fear, madness, despair
3. **Echo** (supernatural corruption): Possession, curses, reality warping
4. **Fortune** (social/resource loss): Debt, betrayal, loss of equipment
5. **Supplies** (resource depletion): Starvation, exposure, equipment failure

Each track fills separately, and different dangers target different tracks.

#### Escalating Fallout

When a stress track fills, you roll for **fallout**:

- **Minor Fallout**: Temporary penalties, recoverable with time
- **Major Fallout**: Permanent changes, character permanently altered
- **Severe Fallout**: Devastating transformations or death

The more stress you have, the worse your potential fallout.

### Narrative Stakes

The Resistance System creates narrative tension through:

- **Impossible Choices**: Do you risk Blood stress (death) or Mind stress (madness)?
- **Resource Management**: Every action has a cost; when do you push and when do you conserve?
- **Permanent Changes**: Fallout cannot be undone, forcing players to adapt
- **Escalation**: Problems don't go away; they multiply and worsen

### Beats and Advancement

Heart uses **beats** (experience points) tied to:

- **Class-Specific Beats**: Advance by pursuing your character's drive
- **Story Beats**: Advance by engaging with the fiction
- **Zenith Abilities**: Powerful capstone abilities earned through significant advancement

Characters advance not by generic XP grinding but by **pursuing their goals**, even if those goals are destructive.

## Mechanical Reinforcement of Themes

### Stress: The Cost of Ambition

The **stress system** embodies the theme that nothing in the Heart is free:

- **Everything Has a Cost**: Even successful actions often inflict stress
- **Multiple Vectors of Harm**: You can't optimize a single defense; you're vulnerable somewhere
- **Accumulation**: Stress builds until it breaks you
- **Visibility**: Players see their doom approaching but must proceed anyway

**Example**: A character might successfully escape a collapsing tunnel (narrative success) but take Blood stress (injury), Fortune stress (lost equipment), and Supplies stress (exhaustion). They succeeded, but they're worse off.

### Fallout: Transformation is Permanent

The **fallout system** ensures that change is irreversible:

- **No Healing Fallout**: Once you've mutated, gone mad, or lost something critical, it's permanent
- **Emergent Character Development**: Fallout creates unexpected character arcs
- **Scars Tell Stories**: Each fallout is a badge of experience and trauma
- **Power Through Sacrifice**: Some classes gain abilities from fallout

**Example**: A character takes Major Mind fallout and develops a phobia of enclosed spaces. This is now a permanent character trait that the player must roleplay.

### Costly Powers: No Free Abilities

Many character abilities **require payment**:

- **Stress as Fuel**: Powerful abilities inflict stress on the user
- **Resource Consumption**: Abilities require rare materials, time, or sacrifice
- **Social Costs**: Using certain powers angers factions or attracts attention
- **Transformation Required**: The most powerful abilities require accepting permanent changes

**Example**: A Junk Mage's most powerful spell requires consuming part of their own body, inflicting permanent Blood fallout.

### Domains and Skills: Narrative Flexibility

The **broad skill system** encourages creative problem-solving:

- **Multiple Approaches**: Most problems can be solved with different skills
- **Fictional Positioning**: How you describe your action matters more than which skill you use
- **Player Agency**: Players choose which stress to risk based on their approach
- **Genre Reinforcement**: The skill list reflects Heart's themes (Kill, Delve, Endure)

**Example**: Escaping a pursuer could be Evade (outrun them), Sneak (hide), Compel (talk them down), Kill (fight them), or even Mend (heal them to change the situation). Each approach risks different stress.

### Death and Finality: Your Story Ends

Heart has **no resurrection or death saves**:

- **When You're Out, You're Out**: Severe fallout can kill you permanently
- **Narrative Deaths**: Players can choose to die meaningfully if they're ready
- **Legacy Matters**: Dead characters influence the story through their actions
- **New Characters Start Experienced**: Replacement characters aren't level 1; they have history

**Example**: A character takes Severe Blood fallout in a climactic moment. Rather than rolling randomly, the player narrates a heroic death saving their companions, making the character's end meaningful.

## Tone, Imagery, and Mood

### Dreamlike Horror

Heart occupies a space between **nightmare and dark fantasy**:

- **Unsettling, Not Jump-Scares**: Horror is pervasive, atmospheric, and psychological
- **Beautiful Grotesque**: Horrific things are described with poetic language
- **Symbolic Rather Than Literal**: Events represent themes, not just plot beats
- **Ambiguity**: It's unclear what's real, what's hallucination, and what's something else

**Example Description**: "The train arrives, dripping. Not with waterâ€”nothing in the Heart is that simpleâ€”but with something thicker, darker. The doors open with a sound like a sigh. Inside, passengers sit in perfect stillness, their eyes tracking your movement. You've never seen them blink."

### Grotesque Beauty

Heart's aesthetic is **horrible but fascinating**:

- **Body Horror as Art**: Mutations are described in visceral detail but also with wonder
- **Architectural Nightmares**: Locations are impossible but aesthetically striking
- **Sensory Overload**: Descriptions engage all senses, often unpleasantly
- **Contradiction**: Something can be revolting and beautiful simultaneously

**Example Description**: "The Hive Queen's chamber is breathtaking: cathedral-high ceilings of wax and chitin, lit by bioluminescent larvae. The air is thick with the smell of honey and rot. The Queen herself is magnificentâ€”thirty feet of segmented beauty, her compound eyes reflecting your face a thousand times. She's the most terrible thing you've ever seen, and you can't look away."

### Inevitable Decay

Everything in Heart is **falling apart**:

- **Entropy Everywhere**: Buildings crumble, equipment fails, bodies deteriorate
- **Time is Enemy**: The longer you stay, the worse things get
- **No Safe Haven**: Even sanctuaries are temporary, precarious, doomed
- **Beauty in Ruins**: Destruction has its own aesthetic

**Example Description**: "Derelictus was a city once. Now it's a memory of one, buildings leaning against each other for support, streets that end in nothing. People live here stillâ€”because where else would they go? The Heart claims everything eventually. Derelictus just accepted it sooner."

### Visceral Detail

Heart doesn't shy from **explicit, uncomfortable description**:

- **Blood and Flesh**: Physical trauma is described in detail
- **Mental Anguish**: Psychological horror is given equal attention
- **Sensory Assault**: Unpleasant smells, tastes, textures feature prominently
- **Bodily Functions**: The text acknowledges the body's less pleasant aspects

**Example Description**: "The Echo stress manifests as your reflection in the puddle starting to move independently. It's not doing what you're doing. It's smiling. You feel something cold sliding under your skin, mapping your veins. When you speak, your voice harmonizes with itself."

### Dark Humor

Despite (or because of) the horror, Heart has **gallows humor**:

- **Absurdity**: Some situations are so ridiculous they loop back to funny
- **Character Wit**: PCs often use humor as a coping mechanism
- **Ironic Situations**: Cosmic jokes at characters' expense
- **Levity in Darkness**: Humor makes horror more bearable and thus more sustainable

**Example**: The book describes a class called "The Junk Mage" whose powers come from eating garbage and whose signature ability is projectile vomiting magical detritus at enemies. It's horrifying and absurd and strangely charming.

## Designer Commentary and Community Interpretations

### Designer Intent (Rowan, Rook, and Decard)

The designers of Heart have discussed their intent in various interviews and materials:

#### On Theme
- **"Heart is about people doing terrible things for good reasons"**: The game explores moral ambiguity and desperation
- **"We wanted fallout to be interesting, not just punitive"**: Consequences should drive story, not just penalize players
- **"The Heart is a character, not a setting"**: The dungeon itself is an antagonist with agency
- **"Change is inevitable; control over that change is what's at stake"**: Players choose how they're destroyed

#### On Mechanical Design
- **"We wanted stress to be omnipresent but not overwhelming"**: Every action has costs, but you're not tallying minor penalties constantly
- **"Fallout should make you want to keep playing, not stop"**: Consequences are interesting complications, not dead ends
- **"The skill system gives players control over their narrative"**: By choosing which skill to use, players choose which stress to risk

#### On Tone
- **"Heart is horror, but it's player-directed horror"**: The GM provides threats, but players choose which nightmares to engage with
- **"We drew from body horror, cosmic horror, and urban decay"**: Multiple horror subgenres inform the aesthetic
- **"The Heart isn't evil; it's indifferent, which is worse"**: The dungeon doesn't hate you; you're just irrelevant

### Community Interpretations

#### The Heart as Metaphor

The community has discussed various metaphorical readings:

- **Capitalism**: The Heart consumes people and spits out changed versions (or doesn't spit them out at all)
- **Addiction**: Delvers keep returning despite knowing it will destroy them
- **Trauma**: The Heart's effects mirror PTSD and other trauma responses
- **Ambition's Cost**: Every great achievement requires sacrifice; the Heart makes that literal

#### Running Heart

Common GM advice from the community:

- **"Yes, and..." Horror**: Don't shut down player ideas; make them worse/weirder
- **Let Fallout Breathe**: Don't rush past consequences; explore what they mean for the character
- **The Heart Adapts**: Tailor nightmares to what your players find disturbing (with consent)
- **Embrace Failure**: Some of the best sessions come from plans falling apart

#### Popular Themes

Community-favorite aspects of Heart:

- **The Vermissian**: Most iconic location; almost every campaign features it
- **Body Horror**: Players enjoy the visceral, transformative aspects
- **Doomed Characters**: Knowing your PC will fall makes every moment precious
- **Weird NPCs**: Heart's NPCs are memorable because they're all damaged or strange

#### Crossover Potential

The community has explored connections to:

- **Lovecraftian Horror**: Cosmic indifference, transformation, forbidden knowledge
- **The Cthulhu Mythos**: Several community hacks blend Heart with Call of Cthulhu
- **Dark Souls**: Themes of death, resurrection, and inevitable failure
- **Alice in Wonderland**: Surreal, dreamlike progression into stranger territory
- **Silent Hill**: Psychological horror made manifest in physical space

## Implications for Cross-Genre Worldbuilding

### For Digital Game Design

Heart's approach offers lessons for video games:

1. **Consequence Design**: Make consequences permanent and interesting, not just numerical penalties
2. **Stress Systems**: Multiple stress tracks allow diverse challenges without making everything about HP
3. **Procedural Horror**: Heart's non-Euclidean geography suggests approaches to procedural generation
4. **Player-Directed Horror**: Let players choose which nightmares to face rather than forcing sequences

**Application to BlueMarble**: 
- A "Heart-like" dungeon could serve as endgame content where normal rules break down
- Stress/corruption systems for prolonged exposure to dangerous zones
- Transformation mechanics tied to acquiring forbidden knowledge or power
- Reality-warping zones where physics and geography become unreliable

### For Horror Writing

Heart demonstrates effective horror techniques:

1. **Accumulation Over Jump-Scares**: Horror builds gradually through accumulated details
2. **Body as Battleground**: Physical transformation is more disturbing than external threats
3. **Beauty in Horror**: Describing terrible things as aesthetically interesting increases impact
4. **Inevitable Doom**: Characters facing inescapable death are more compelling than invincible heroes

**Application to BlueMarble**:
- Corrupted zones with gradual transformation effects
- Eldritch artifacts that grant power at a terrible cost
- NPCs who have been changed by their experiences in ways that can't be undone

### For Economic/Social Systems

Heart's faction and resource design offers insights:

1. **Desperate Economies**: In Heart, every resource is precious and trade is unfair
2. **Reputation Matters**: Your past actions follow you; there's no clean slate
3. **Faction Complexity**: Groups have understandable motivations even when hostile
4. **Alternative Currencies**: Glimmers, information, favors, and body parts are all valuable

**Application to BlueMarble**:
- Tiered economies where different zones use different currencies
- Reputation systems with permanent consequences
- Barter systems for rare or forbidden goods
- Risk/reward mechanics for entering dangerous zones

### For Narrative Design

Heart's storytelling approach:

1. **Character-Driven Horror**: The scariest moments come from character choices, not random events
2. **Ambiguous Morality**: No clear good/evil; everyone is desperate and compromised
3. **Environmental Storytelling**: Locations tell stories through their decay and inhabitants
4. **Player Agency in Failure**: How you fail matters more than whether you succeed

**Application to BlueMarble**:
- Quests with no clear "good" outcome; every choice has costs
- Environmental storytelling through ruined locations
- NPC factions with understandable but conflicting goals
- Player choices that permanently alter the world state

### For Progression Systems

Heart's advancement mechanics:

1. **Goal-Based XP**: Characters advance by pursuing their drives, not grinding
2. **Horizontal Progression**: Characters get different, not just better
3. **Cost of Power**: New abilities often come with drawbacks
4. **Transformation as Growth**: Becoming more powerful means becoming less human

**Application to BlueMarble**:
- Alternative progression paths tied to player goals
- Abilities that have meaningful costs or requirements
- Specialization that closes off other options
- Corruption/transformation systems tied to power acquisition

## Conclusion

Heart: The City Beneath is a masterclass in thematic coherence. Every mechanical system, location, and narrative element reinforces its core themes of risk, transformation, and inevitable doom. The Resistance System elegantly converts those themes into playable mechanics that create emergent stories about desperate people doing terrible things in pursuit of impossible goals.

For designers, writers, and worldbuilders, Heart offers:

- **Mechanical Innovation**: How to make consequences permanent, interesting, and meaningful
- **Tonal Consistency**: How to maintain horror atmosphere through both rules and description
- **Thematic Depth**: How to make every element of a game reinforce its core message
- **Player Agency**: How to give players control over their doom rather than removing all stakes

The Heart itselfâ€”a living, hostile, transformative dungeon that warps reality and devours soulsâ€”stands as one of the most compelling horror settings in modern RPG design, suitable for adaptation across genres and media.
