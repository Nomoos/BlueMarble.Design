## Skill System Overview

### Core System Architecture

Life is Feudal implements a **skill-based progression system** fundamentally different from class-based MMORPGs:

```
Life is Feudal Skill System:
├─ ~50 available skills
├─ All skills theoretically accessible to any character
├─ Hard cap: 600 total skill points maximum
├─ Skills improve through use (no point allocation)
├─ Exponential difficulty curve (early gains fast, later gains slow)
├─ Skill tiers unlock abilities at 30/60/90 points
├─ Parent skills provide bonuses to child skills
└─ Alignment system restricts certain skill combinations

Forced Specialization:
- 600 total points ÷ 100 max per skill = Only 6 skills can be maxed
- Practical specialization: 2-3 primary skills + several supporting skills
- Multi-character requirement for full game experience
```

### Design Philosophy

**Interdependence Through Scarcity:**
- No single character can master all skills
- Players must cooperate and trade for complex projects
- Creates natural economic ecosystems
- Encourages guild formation and specialization roles

**Use-Based Progression:**
- Skills improve by performing related actions
- More challenging tasks provide better skill gains
- Failures still grant small experience ("pain tolerance")
- Natural learning curve from novice to master

**Meaningful Choices:**
- Every skill point invested is a strategic decision
- Respecialization is difficult (limited or expensive)
- Character identity emerges from specialization choices
- Long-term consequences of early decisions

## Skill Progression Mechanics

### Use-Based Skill Gain

**Core Mechanic:** Skills improve through repeated use, not point allocation

```
Skill Gain Formula:
gain = base_gain × difficulty_modifier × success_modifier × parent_bonus × quality_bonus

Where:
- base_gain: Decreases as skill increases (diminishing returns)
- difficulty_modifier: Actions matching skill level give optimal gains
- success_modifier: Failures grant reduced gains (pain tolerance system)
- parent_bonus: Parent skill level provides bonus multiplier
- quality_bonus: Higher quality materials/tools increase gains

Optimal Gain Zone:
- Tasks slightly above current skill level = maximum experience
- Tasks far below skill level = minimal experience (trivial)
- Tasks far above skill level = minimal experience (too hard)
```

**Practical Example: Blacksmithing Progression**

```
Skill Level 0-30 (Novice Tier):
├─ Craft: Simple nails, hooks, handles
├─ Gain per success: 0.5-1.0 points
├─ Time per craft: ~10-20 seconds
├─ Materials: Minimal iron ingots
├─ Success rate: 90-100%
└─ Progression speed: Fast (30 points in 3-5 hours)

Skill Level 30-60 (Journeyman Tier):
├─ Craft: Horseshoes, tools, simple weapons
├─ Gain per success: 0.3-0.6 points
├─ Time per craft: ~30-60 seconds
├─ Materials: Moderate iron + quality concerns
├─ Success rate: 70-90%
├─ Tier 2 recipes unlocked
└─ Progression speed: Moderate (30 points in 10-15 hours)

Skill Level 60-90 (Expert Tier):
├─ Craft: Quality weapons, armor pieces, tools
├─ Gain per success: 0.1-0.3 points
├─ Time per craft: ~2-5 minutes
├─ Materials: Significant iron + alloys + quality materials
├─ Success rate: 60-80%
├─ Tier 3 recipes unlocked
└─ Progression speed: Slow (30 points in 30-50 hours)

Skill Level 90-100 (Master Tier):
├─ Craft: Masterwork weapons, exceptional armor
├─ Gain per success: 0.01-0.05 points
├─ Time per craft: ~10-30 minutes
├─ Materials: Rare/expensive materials, quality requirements
├─ Success rate: High quality output (90-100 quality items)
├─ Master recipes unlocked
└─ Progression speed: Very slow (10 points in 50-100 hours)

Total time to master: 200-300 hours of dedicated crafting
```

### Skill Tier System

**Three-Tier Unlock Structure:** Skills unlock new abilities at specific thresholds

```
Tier Structure:

0-29: Novice Tier
├─ Basic recipes available
├─ High failure rate on complex items
├─ Low quality output (10-40 quality)
├─ Limited efficiency
└─ Learning fundamentals

30-59: Journeyman Tier
├─ Tier 2 recipes unlocked
├─ Moderate success rate
├─ Average quality output (40-70 quality)
├─ Improved efficiency
├─ Can use advanced tools
└─ Professional capability emerges

60-89: Expert Tier
├─ Tier 3 recipes unlocked
├─ High success rate
├─ Good quality output (60-90 quality)
├─ High efficiency
├─ Can craft quality tools for others
└─ Recognized specialist

90-100: Master Tier
├─ Master recipes unlocked
├─ Very high success rate
├─ Exceptional quality output (80-100 quality)
├─ Maximum efficiency
├─ Can teach others effectively
├─ Elite craftsperson status
└─ Community asset
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- Reaching 30 in a skill makes you competent
- Reaching 60 makes you a professional
- Reaching 90 makes you a specialist
- Reaching 100 makes you a master (rare and valuable)

### Difficulty Curve and Time Investment

**Exponential Difficulty Progression:**

```
Time Investment by Skill Level:

0 → 10:   ~1 hour    (Fast gains, learning basics)
10 → 20:  ~2 hours   (Still fast, establishing fundamentals)
20 → 30:  ~3 hours   (Moderate, approaching competence)
30 → 40:  ~5 hours   (Slowing down, Tier 2 unlocked)
40 → 50:  ~8 hours   (Noticeably slower)
50 → 60:  ~12 hours  (Significant time investment)
60 → 70:  ~20 hours  (Expert territory, slow gains)
70 → 80:  ~35 hours  (Very slow, dedication required)
80 → 90:  ~60 hours  (Extreme dedication)
90 → 100: ~100 hours (Master level, rare achievement)

Total: ~250-300 hours to master a single skill
```

**Pain Tolerance System:**
- Failed crafts still grant 10-30% of success experience
- Reduces frustration for difficult recipes
- Encourages experimentation without total loss
- Makes leveling expensive skills less punishing

## Specialization System

### Hard Skill Cap Mechanics

**The 600-Point Cap:** Most defining feature of Life is Feudal's skill system

```
Skill Cap Mathematics:

Total Available Points: 600
Maximum per Skill: 100

Theoretical Maximum Skills:
- 600 ÷ 100 = 6 skills fully maxed
- Realistic: 2-3 primary skills (80-100) + several support skills (30-60)

Example Character Distribution:

Combat Specialist:
├─ Primary Combat Skill: 100 points
├─ Secondary Combat Skill: 90 points
├─ Tertiary Combat Skill: 80 points
├─ Armor Crafting: 60 points (self-sufficiency)
├─ Cooking: 40 points (sustenance)
├─ Nature Lore: 30 points (healing)
├─ Unit Formation: 30 points (tactics)
├─ Authority: 30 points (leadership)
├─ Horseback Riding: 30 points (mobility)
└─ Remaining: 110 points for utility skills

Total: 600 points (hard cap reached)

Crafting Specialist:
├─ Blacksmithing: 100 points
├─ Mining: 90 points
├─ Smelting: 80 points
├─ Artisan: 60 points (parent skill bonus)
├─ Carpentry: 50 points (tool crafting)
├─ Forestry: 40 points (charcoal production)
├─ Construction: 40 points (infrastructure)
├─ Prospecting: 30 points (ore location)
├─ Masonry: 30 points (furnace building)
└─ Remaining: 80 points for utility

Total: 600 points (hard cap reached)
```

**Consequences of Hard Cap:**
1. **Forced Specialization:** Cannot be "good at everything"
2. **Player Interdependence:** Must rely on others for specialized services
3. **Economic Value:** Master craftspeople are valuable community assets
4. **Strategic Planning:** Early skill choices have long-term consequences
5. **Multi-Character Pressure:** Some players create multiple characters (alt pressure)

### Parent-Child Skill Relationships

**Hierarchical Skill Structure:** Parent skills boost related child skills

```
Skill Family Example: Metalworking Tree

Artisan [Tier 1 Parent]
├─ Skill Type: General crafting parent
├─ Max Level: 100 points
├─ Bonus: +0.1 per point to all crafting children
├─ Effect: At 100 Artisan → +10 effective points to all child crafting skills
└─ Strategic Value: Broad foundation for multiple crafting paths

    └─── Smelting [Tier 2 Parent]
         ├─ Requires: Artisan knowledge
         ├─ Max Level: 100 points
         ├─ Bonus: +0.15 per point to metalworking children
         ├─ Enables: Metal ingot production, alloy creation
         └─ Effect: At 70 Smelting → +10.5 effective points to children

              └─── Blacksmithing [Tier 3 Child]
                   ├─ Requires: Smelting + Artisan knowledge
                   ├─ Max Level: 100 points
                   ├─ Effective Skill Calculation:
                   │    Base Blacksmithing: 60 points
                   │  + Artisan Bonus (80 × 0.1): +8 points
                   │  + Smelting Bonus (70 × 0.15): +10.5 points
                   │  = Effective Blacksmithing: 78.5 points
                   │
                   ├─ Benefits:
                   │    • Higher quality crafts than base skill suggests
                   │    • Can craft items requiring 78.5 skill with only 60 base
                   │    • Parent investment creates skill efficiency
                   └─ Strategic Implication: Investing in parents multiplies effectiveness

Alternative Tree Example: Combat Skills

Unit Formation [Tier 1 Parent]
├─ Bonus: +0.1 per point to combat skills
├─ Effect: Leadership and group combat efficiency
└─ At 50: +5 effective points to all combat children

    ├─── Lance [Tier 2 Child]
    │    └─ Benefits from Unit Formation parent
    │
    ├─── Swords [Tier 2 Child]
    │    └─ Benefits from Unit Formation parent
    │
    └─── Archery [Tier 2 Child]
         └─ Benefits from Unit Formation parent
```

**Strategic Skill Investment:**
- Raise parent skills first for broader benefits
- Deep child specialization with parent support creates mastery
- Synergy between related skill families multiplies effectiveness
- Point-efficient to max parents before children

## Alignment System

### Crafting vs Combat Alignment

**Fundamental Character Choice:** Players must choose a primary path

```
Alignment System Overview:

Crafting Alignment:
├─ Focus: Production, building, resource processing
├─ Restricted Access: Cannot excel in combat skills
├─ Skill Affinity: Crafting skills level faster (+15-25%)
├─ Combat Penalty: Combat skills level slower (-30-50%)
├─ Social Role: Economic backbone, supplier
└─ Playstyle: Peaceful, cooperative, build-focused

Combat Alignment:
├─ Focus: Warfare, territorial control, military operations
├─ Restricted Access: Cannot excel in crafting skills
├─ Skill Affinity: Combat skills level faster (+15-25%)
├─ Crafting Penalty: Crafting skills level slower (-30-50%)
├─ Social Role: Military force, defender, aggressor
└─ Playstyle: Aggressive, competitive, PvP-focused

Neutral/Hybrid Path:
├─ Focus: Balanced approach to both areas
├─ No Bonuses: Standard skill leveling rates
├─ No Penalties: Can access all skills equally
├─ Flexibility: Can pivot between roles
└─ Trade-off: Not as efficient as specialized alignments
```

**Strategic Implications:**

```
Alignment Choice Consequences:

Crafting-Aligned Character:
- Can master Blacksmithing, Mining, Smelting efficiently
- Cannot become elite warrior (combat skills capped lower)
- Relies on combat-aligned guildmates for protection
- Essential for guild economy and infrastructure
- Safe in guarded territories but vulnerable in wilderness

Combat-Aligned Character:
- Can master multiple weapon skills and armor proficiencies
- Cannot craft own equipment efficiently (must trade)
- Relies on crafting-aligned guildmates for gear
- Essential for guild defense and territorial control
- Strong in PvP but dependent on crafters for supplies

Neutral Character:
- Can dabble in both crafting and combat
- Will not reach peak efficiency in either area
- Flexible role within guilds
- Good for solo players who want self-sufficiency
- Jack of all trades, master of none
```

**Guild Composition:** Balanced guilds need both alignments

```
Optimal Guild Structure (50-person guild):

Crafting-Aligned: ~30 members (60%)
├─ 5 Master Blacksmiths
├─ 5 Master Carpenters
├─ 4 Master Tailors
├─ 4 Miners/Prospectors
├─ 3 Farmers/Cooks
├─ 3 Masons/Builders
├─ 3 Herbalists/Alchemists
├─ 2 Architects
└─ 1 Lorekeeper

Combat-Aligned: ~15 members (30%)
├─ 5 Heavy Infantry
├─ 4 Cavalry
├─ 3 Archers
├─ 2 Siege Engineers
└─ 1 Military Commander

Neutral: ~5 members (10%)
├─ Flexible support roles
├─ Emergency backup for either alignment
└─ Trading specialists, diplomats

Economic Model:
- Crafters produce equipment and supplies
- Warriors provide protection and territorial control
- Resources flow: Crafters → Warriors → Territory → Resources → Crafters
```

### Alignment Switching

**Respecialization Mechanics:** Changing alignment is possible but costly

```
Alignment Change Process:

Prerequisites:
├─ Character must be at least 30 days old (real-time)
├─ Must pay significant resource cost (varies by server)
├─ May require quest completion or GM approval
└─ Limited frequency (once every 90 days typical)

Consequences:
├─ All skills in restricted category capped at current level
├─ Can no longer gain experience in restricted skills
├─ New alignment affinity applies to newly-aligned skills
├─ Previous bonuses removed, new bonuses applied
└─ Character identity fundamentally changes

Strategic Considerations:
- Early alignment choice matters long-term
- Changing alignment wastes invested skill points
- Guild role may change significantly
- Economic position affected
- Social relationships may shift
```

## Knowledge and Recipe Systems

### Recipe Discovery Mechanics

**Learning New Crafts:** Knowledge acquisition through multiple paths

```
Recipe Discovery Methods:

1. Skill Tier Unlocks (Automatic)
├─ Reaching skill milestones (30/60/90) unlocks recipes
├─ Example: Blacksmithing 60 → unlocks steel weapon recipes
├─ Guaranteed progression path
└─ Core crafting options always available

2. Experimentation (Discovery)
├─ Combine materials in crafting interface
├─ Random chance to discover new recipe
├─ Higher skill increases discovery chance
├─ Failed experiments consume materials
└─ Exciting "eureka" moments for players

3. Recipe Books (Knowledge Transfer)
├─ Physical items containing recipe information
├─ Crafted by players with high skill
├─ Can be traded, sold, or gifted
├─ Reading book teaches recipe permanently
└─ Knowledge economy emerges

4. Teaching (Social Learning)
├─ Master craftspeople can teach apprentices
├─ Requires both players present
├─ Teacher gains small experience for teaching
├─ Student learns recipe faster than discovery
└─ Mentorship relationships form

5. Looting (Rare Drops)
├─ Some recipes drop from specific activities
├─ Rare recipes highly valuable
├─ Creates economic incentives for exploration
└─ Collectible recipes for completionists
```

**Strategic Knowledge Management:**

```
Knowledge as Economic Asset:

Rare Recipe Value Chain:
1. Discovery: Player experiments and finds rare recipe
2. Protection: Keeps recipe secret or shares selectively
3. Monopoly: Only crafter on server with recipe
4. Premium Pricing: Can charge higher for unique items
5. Economic Power: Wealth accumulation from monopoly
6. Knowledge Sharing: Eventually spreads through teaching/books
7. Competition: Others discover same recipe, prices fall

Guild Knowledge Libraries:
├─ Guilds maintain recipe book collections
├─ New members gain access to guild knowledge
├─ Shared recipes create standardized quality
├─ Knowledge becomes guild asset
└─ Guild recruitment based on unique recipes
```

### Building Knowledge and Heraldry

**Social Recognition Systems:**

```
Title and Recognition System:

Skill-Based Titles:
├─ Novice Smith (Blacksmithing 0-29)
├─ Journeyman Smith (Blacksmithing 30-59)
├─ Expert Smith (Blacksmithing 60-89)
├─ Master Smith (Blacksmithing 90-100)
└─ Legendary Smith (100 + significant achievements)

Heraldry and Symbols:
├─ Players can create personal heraldry
├─ Guild heraldry identifies affiliation
├─ Heraldry displayed on equipment, buildings, banners
├─ Reputation visible through symbols
└─ Social status communicated visually

Monument Building:
├─ Large-scale projects require massive cooperation
├─ Completed monuments provide server-wide benefits
├─ Builder names permanently recorded
├─ Legacy system for long-term engagement
└─ Community accomplishments celebrated
```

├─ Build monopoly vs support community
├─ Economic vs social optimization
└─ Long-term reputation impact
```

### Economic Impact of Specialization

**Player Interdependence Creates Vibrant Economy:**

```
Economic Ecosystem Example:

Master Blacksmith (Player A):
├─ Needs: Iron ore, charcoal, leather (for grips)
├─ Produces: Weapons, armor, tools
├─ Trades With: Miners, Foresters, Leatherworkers
└─ Dependent On: 3-5 other specialists

Master Miner (Player B):
├─ Needs: Tools (picks, shovels), food, equipment repairs
├─ Produces: Iron ore, coal, stone
├─ Trades With: Blacksmiths, Farmers, Tool crafters
└─ Dependent On: 3-5 other specialists

Master Farmer (Player C):
├─ Needs: Tools (scythes, hoes), buildings, storage
├─ Produces: Food, cooking ingredients, livestock
├─ Trades With: Carpenters, Blacksmiths, Cooks
└─ Dependent On: 3-5 other specialists

Circulation:
Miner → Ore → Blacksmith → Tools → Miner (cycle continues)
Farmer → Food → All Players → Work → Resources → Farmer
Specialist → Product → Economy → Resources → Specialist

Result: No player self-sufficient, all players interdependent
```
