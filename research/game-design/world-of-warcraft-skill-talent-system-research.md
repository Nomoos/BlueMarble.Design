## Executive Summary

This research document analyzes World of Warcraft's skill, talent, and profession systems to identify
design patterns and best practices that can inform BlueMarble's skill and knowledge progression systems.
As one of the most successful and longest-running MMORPGs, WoW's approach to character progression,
specialization, and player choice provides valuable lessons for game design.

**Key Findings:**

- WoW uses a class-based system with 13 classes, each having 3 specializations (39 total playstyles)
- Talent system has evolved from classic tree design to modern choice nodes (Dragonflight)
- Profession system separates crafting from combat, with 11 primary professions

## Class System Structure

### Overview

World of Warcraft uses a **class-based system** where character creation determines available abilities
and playstyle options. This provides strong character identity but limits flexibility compared to
skill-based systems.

### The 13 Classes

WoW features 13 distinct classes, each with unique themes, abilities, and roles:

**Tank Classes** (Absorb damage, protect allies):
- Death Knight (Plate armor, undead theme)
- Demon Hunter (Leather armor, demonic powers)
- Druid (Leather armor, shapeshifting - also Healer/DPS)
- Monk (Leather armor, martial arts - also Healer/DPS)
- Paladin (Plate armor, holy warrior - also Healer/DPS)
- Warrior (Plate armor, weapon master - also DPS)

**Healer Classes** (Restore health, support):
- Druid (Nature magic, HoTs)
- Evoker (Mail armor, draconic magic - also DPS)
- Monk (Chi energy, mobile healing)
- Paladin (Holy light, armor healing)
- Priest (Holy/Discipline magic - also DPS)
- Shaman (Elemental/spiritual healing - also DPS)

**DPS Classes** (Damage dealers):
- Demon Hunter (Melee, mobility)
- Death Knight (Melee, disease/frost/unholy)
- Hunter (Ranged physical, pets)
- Mage (Ranged magic, arcane/fire/frost)
- Rogue (Melee, stealth)
- Warlock (Ranged magic, demons, DoTs)
- Plus: Warrior, Druid, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Shaman, Evoker

### Specialization Structure

Each class has **3 specializations** (except Demon Hunter and Evoker with 2), defining core playstyle:

```
Example: Warrior Class
├── Arms Specialization (Melee DPS - Two-handed weapons)
│   ├── Core Identity: Tactical mastery, big hits
│   ├── Key Mechanics: Rage generation, Execute phase
│   └── Playstyle: Burst damage, cooldown management
│
├── Fury Specialization (Melee DPS - Dual-wielding)
│   ├── Core Identity: Berserker rage, constant action
│   ├── Key Mechanics: Enrage uptime, dual-wield
│   └── Playstyle: Fast-paced, sustained damage
│
└── Protection Specialization (Tank)
    ├── Core Identity: Shield master, defensive stance
    ├── Key Mechanics: Shield Block, Ignore Pain
    └── Playstyle: Damage mitigation, threat generation
```

### Class Design Principles

**Strengths:**
- **Clear Identity:** Each class has distinct fantasy and mechanics
- **Role Definition:** Tank/Healer/DPS roles clearly defined
- **Balanced Complexity:** Entry-level accessibility with mastery depth
- **Specialization Choice:** 3 specs allow role flexibility within class

**Limitations:**
- **Inflexible:** Cannot cross class boundaries (Warrior can't cast spells)
- **Alt Pressure:** Different playstyles require multiple characters
- **Balance Challenges:** 39 specs difficult to balance perfectly
- **Meta Dominance:** "Best" specs can overshadow others

### Ability Acquisition

**Automatic Progression:**
- Core class abilities unlock automatically at specific levels
- Specialization abilities unlock when choosing spec
- No skill points or manual allocation for base abilities
- Simplifies progression but reduces player agency

**Leveling Progression (1-70):**
- Level 1: Starting abilities (2-3 basic attacks)
- Levels 1-10: Core rotation abilities unlock
- Level 10: Choose specialization, gain spec abilities
- Levels 11-70: Progressive ability unlocks
- Max level: Full kit of 15-25 active abilities per spec

## Talent System Evolution

### Classic WoW Talent Trees (2004-2010)

The original talent system used deep tree structures with point allocation.

**Classic Tree Structure:**
```
Warrior - Arms Talent Tree (31 points maximum)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Tier 1 (Level 10)
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Improved Heroic │ Deflection       │ Improved Rend   │
│ Strike          │ (Parry +X%)      │ (Rend damage)   │
│ (Reduce CD)     │ [5 points]       │ [3 points]      │
│ [3 points]      │                  │                 │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘

Tier 2 (Level 15)
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Tactical        │ Improved         │ Deep Wounds     │
│ Mastery         │ Overpower        │ (DoT effect)    │
│ (Rage cost)     │ (Crit chance)    │ [3 points]      │
│ [5 points]      │ [2 points]       │                 │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘

Tier 3-7: Progressive unlocks requiring points in tree
...

Tier 7 (Level 40 - Capstone)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mortal Strike                                   │
│ Requires: 30 points in Arms                     │
│ Ultimate ability defining specialization         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Classic Characteristics:**
- **51 talent points** total (levels 10-60)
- **3 trees per class** (can mix-and-match)
- **Point requirements:** Deeper talents require points in tree
- **Capstone abilities:** Defining abilities at tree end (31+ points)
- **Flexibility:** Can spread points across multiple trees

**Classic Problems:**
- Cookie-cutter builds dominated (31/5/15 standard formats)
- Many "mandatory" talents reduced real choice
- Trap talents that seemed good but weren't
- Respec costs limited experimentation

### Cataclysm Redesign (2010-2012)

**Changes:**
- Choose primary specialization at level 10
- Talents within chosen spec only
- Reduced total talents but more impactful choices
- Removed "+1% damage" filler talents

### Mists of Pandaria Overhaul (2012-2014)

Major redesign moving away from trees entirely.

**New Structure:**
- **Choice Nodes:** 7 tiers, 3 choices each
- **Level-gated:** Unlock new tier every 15 levels
- **Spec-agnostic:** Same choices across all specs of class
- **No prerequisites:** Any choice available at each tier

```
Mists of Pandaria Talent Structure
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Level 15: Movement/Mobility Tier
[ Choice 1 ]  [ Choice 2 ]  [ Choice 3 ]
   
Level 30: Survivability Tier
[ Choice 1 ]  [ Choice 2 ]  [ Choice 3 ]

Level 45: Utility Tier
[ Choice 1 ]  [ Choice 2 ]  [ Choice 3 ]

... (continues to level 100)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer choices between meaningful options
- Easier to balance (7 tiers × 3 choices = 21 talents vs 100+)
- Reduced trap options
- Encouraged experimentation (easy switching)

**Drawbacks:**
- Less character customization depth
- Felt more limited than trees
- Some players missed point allocation fantasy

### Dragonflight Modern System (2022-Present)

Latest evolution combines tree structure with choice node flexibility.

**Dual Talent Tree System:**

```

**Specialization Effects:**

1. **Quality Improvement:**
   - Higher specialization = better quality crafts
   - Quality tiers: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4 → Tier 5
   - Specialization can add +1 or +2 quality tiers

2. **Inspiration Chance:**
   - Random chance to craft higher quality than skill allows
   - Specialization increases inspiration chance
   - Can unexpectedly craft Tier 5 from Tier 3 skill

3. **Resourcefulness:**
   - Chance to use fewer materials
   - Reduces crafting costs
   - Valuable for expensive recipes

4. **Multicraft:**
   - Chance to create additional items (1.5x or 2x output)
   - Effectively increases profit margins
   - Valuable for consumables

5. **Skill Bonuses:**
   - Direct bonuses to profession skill in specialized area
   - +10, +20, +50 skill in narrow specializations
   - Allows crafting higher quality in chosen niche

### Specialization Strategy

**Specialization Decisions:**

Players must choose between:
- **Broad competence:** Spread points for general capability
- **Deep specialization:** Focus on narrow area for mastery
- **Economic optimization:** Specialize in profitable niches

**Example Specialization Paths:**

**Path 1: Weaponsmith Specialist**
```
Investment: 100 Knowledge Points
- Weapon Smithing: 40 points (Foundation)
  - Swords: 30 points (Deep specialization)
    - Two-Handed Swords: 30 points (Mastery)
    
Result: Best two-handed sword crafter on server
        Known for Tier 5 quality swords
        Cannot craft good armor
```

**Path 2: Generalist Blacksmith**
```
Investment: 100 Knowledge Points
- Armor Smithing: 30 points
  - Plate: 10 points
  - Mail: 10 points
- Weapon Smithing: 30 points
  - Swords: 10 points
  - Axes: 10 points
- Tools: 10 points

Result: Can craft everything at decent quality
        No server-best items
        More flexible for self-sufficiency
```

### Integration with Crafting Orders

**Crafting Order System:**
- Players commission crafters to make items
- Provide materials or pay for crafted item
- System shows crafter specializations
- High specialization = premium prices
- Creates natural economy for specialists

**Quality Guarantees:**
