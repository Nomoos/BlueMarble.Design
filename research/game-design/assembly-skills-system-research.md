## Skill Progression Mechanics

### Experience Gain Model

**Practice-Based System:**
```
Experience Gained = Base_XP × Material_Difficulty × Item_Complexity × Success_Modifier

Where:
- Base_XP = 10 (constant)
- Material_Difficulty = 0.5 to 3.0 (harder materials give more XP)
- Item_Complexity = 0.5 to 5.0 (complex items give more XP)
- Success_Modifier = 1.0 (success), 0.3 (failure but learned), 1.5 (critical success)
```

**Level Requirements:**
```
XP_Required(Level) = 100 × Level^1.5

Example progression:
Level 1 → 2: 100 XP
Level 10 → 11: 3,162 XP
Level 50 → 51: 35,355 XP
Level 99 → 100: 98,995 XP
```

This creates a natural learning curve where:
- Early levels advance quickly (learning basics)
- Mid levels require sustained practice (developing skill)
- High levels demand mastery (perfecting technique)

### Success Rate Formula

**Base Success Rate:**
```
Success_Rate = Base_Rate + Skill_Bonus - Material_Penalty - Complexity_Penalty + Tool_Bonus + 
               Environment_Bonus

Where:
- Base_Rate = 50% (minimum)
- Skill_Bonus = (Current_Skill / Recommended_Skill) × 30%
- Material_Penalty = Material_Quality_Variance × 10%
- Complexity_Penalty = Item_Complexity × 5%
- Tool_Bonus = Tool_Quality × 15%
- Environment_Bonus = Workshop_Quality × 10%

Capped between 10% (minimum) and 95% (maximum)
```

**Example Calculations:**

*Novice Blacksmith (Level 5) crafting Iron Sword (Recommended Level 8):*
```
Base_Rate = 50%
Skill_Bonus = (5/8) × 30% = 18.75%
Material_Penalty = 0% (standard iron)
Complexity_Penalty = 2 × 5% = 10%
Tool_Bonus = 10% (basic tools)
Environment_Bonus = 5% (basic forge)

Success_Rate = 50% + 18.75% - 10% + 10% + 5% = 73.75%
```

*Master Blacksmith (Level 80) crafting Iron Sword:*
```
Base_Rate = 50%
Skill_Bonus = (80/8) × 30% = 30% (capped at recommended skill)
Material_Penalty = 0%
Complexity_Penalty = 10%
Tool_Bonus = 15% (masterwork tools)
Environment_Bonus = 10% (advanced forge)

Success_Rate = 50% + 30% - 10% + 15% + 10% = 95% (maximum)
```

```
Skill Level: 3
Recommended Level: 2
Material Quality: 60% (standard linen)
Tool Quality: 50% (basic needle and thread)
Environment: 40% (no workshop)

Success_Rate = 50% + (3/2 × 30%) + 0 - (1 × 5%) + (0.5 × 15%) + (0.4 × 10%)
            = 50% + 45% - 5% + 7.5% + 4%
            = 101.5% → 95% (capped)

Result: Very high success chance, appropriate for learning
```

**Example 2: Intermediate Alchemist Crafting Healing Potion**
```
Skill Level: 35
Recommended Level: 30
Material Quality: 80% (high-quality herbs)
Tool Quality: 70% (good alembic)
Environment: 60% (basic laboratory)

Success_Rate = 50% + (35/30 × 30%) + 0 - (2 × 5%) + (0.7 × 15%) + (0.6 × 10%)
            = 50% + 35% - 10% + 10.5% + 6%
            = 91.5%

Quality_Expected = (35/100 × 40%) + (80/100 × 30%) + (70/100 × 20%) + (60/100 × 10%)
                 = 14% + 24% + 14% + 6%
                 = 58% (Standard Quality, approaching Fine)
```

**Example 3: Master Blacksmith Crafting Legendary Sword**
```
Skill Level: 95
Recommended Level: 90
Material Quality: 98% (meteoritic steel)
Tool Quality: 95% (masterwork tools)
Environment: 90% (legendary forge)

Success_Rate = 50% + (95/90 × 30%) + 0 - (5 × 5%) + (0.95 × 15%) + (0.9 × 10%)
            = 50% + 31.7% - 25% + 14.25% + 9%
            = 79.95%

Quality_Expected = (95/100 × 40%) + (98/100 × 30%) + (95/100 × 20%) + (90/100 × 10%)
                 = 38% + 29.4% + 19% + 9%
                 = 95.4% (Masterwork Quality)

Note: High complexity reduces success rate but doesn't affect quality calculation
