# Step 3: Integration Design

## Overview

This step focuses on designing how researched game systems integrate with BlueMarble's geological simulation architecture, ensuring scientific accuracy while enabling engaging gameplay mechanics.

## Status

**In Development** - Integration design documentation is currently being developed based on research findings from Step 2.

## Current Content

### Economic System Design
**[Economic System Design Document](economic-system-design.md)** - Complete economic simulation system inspired by Port Royale and classic trading games.

**[Interactive Prototype](prototype/)** - Working demonstration with real-time market dynamics, trade routes, and production chains.

**Features Implemented**:
- 11 commodities across 4 categories with realistic properties
- Dynamic market pricing with supply/demand mechanics
- Production chains with manufacturing dependencies
- 4 ship types with different capacities and speeds
- Regional specialization and geographic integration
- Trade route profitability calculator
- Visual map representation

## Planned Content

### Skill System Integration
- Geological knowledge progression pathways
- Skill tree design with parent-child relationships
- Integration with existing BlueMarble spatial systems
- Educational alignment and learning outcomes

### Material System Integration
- Geological formation quality mapping
- Material property extraction from simulation
- Processing chain design with quality inheritance
- Economic system integration

### Crafting System Integration
- Geological tool requirements and usage
- Workstation design for geological context
- Recipe system aligned with scientific accuracy
- Multi-stage geological processing

### Economic System Integration
- Resource distribution based on geological reality
- Trade network emergence from geographic specialization
- Guild system implementation
- Player-driven economy mechanics

## Design Principles

### Scientific Accuracy First
All mechanics must align with geological principles and maintain educational value.

### Backward Compatibility
Integration must extend existing systems without breaking current functionality.

### Performance Requirements
Real-time response (16ms movement, 250ms operations) must be maintained.

### Player Agency
Systems should enable creative problem-solving based on geological understanding.
