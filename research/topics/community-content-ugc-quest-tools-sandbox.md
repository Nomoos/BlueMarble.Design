## Research Question

**Should BlueMarble allow players to create side quests via User-Generated Content (UGC) tools,
and if so, what systems enable quality community content?**

**Research Context:**

Following the research showing that optional side quests are highly valued in sandbox games, and
the open question about "content velocity" (generating enough quality quests), this research
examines whether UGC tools can help fill BlueMarble's world with discoverable content while
maintaining quality standards.

---

## Executive Summary

Research indicates that **well-designed UGC quest systems can multiply content 10-100x** while
maintaining quality through curation, but require **significant upfront tooling investment** and
**active community management**.

**Key Findings:**

1. **UGC Multiplies Content** - Successful UGC generates 80-95% of total quest content
2. **Curation is Critical** - Quality control systems prevent low-effort spam
3. **Tools Must Be Accessible** - Complex editors limit creator pool to <5% of players
4. **Incentives Drive Quality** - Recognition, rewards, and feedback loops matter

**Critical Insight for BlueMarble:**

Geological sandbox is ideal for UGC quests because the simulation provides authentic challenges
that don't require complex scripting - players design discovery experiences, not storylines.
