# Research Topics

This directory contains small, focused research notes on specific topics. Each file should be
self-contained and cover one research question or area.

## Guidelines

- **One topic per file**: Each file covers a single, focused research question
- **File size**: Target 200-400 lines (~500-800 words)
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case: `enemy-ai-overview.md`, `pathfinding-comparison-a-star-vs-navmesh.md`
- **Front matter**: Include metadata at the top of each file

## Front Matter Template

```markdown
---
title: Topic Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
owner: @username
status: draft | in-progress | complete
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

## Structure

Each topic note should include:

1. **Problem/Context**: What question are we answering?
2. **Key Findings**: Main discoveries (bullets)
3. **Evidence**: Links, quotes, data
4. **Implications**: How does this affect design?
5. **Next Steps**: Open questions or follow-up research

## Examples

Good topic files:

- `procedural-generation-trees.md` - Specific technique
- `player-motivation-self-determination.md` - Focused concept
- `combat-pacing-analysis.md` - Single system analysis
- `gender-macro-micro-aiming-preferences.md` - Research on gameplay control preferences across demographics

Too broad (should be split):

- `game-systems.md` - Multiple unrelated topics
- `research-notes.md` - Vague, catch-all file

## Cross-Linking

Link related topics and reference them in the [research index](../index.md).
