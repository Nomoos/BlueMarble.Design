## Core Mechanics

### The 3d6 Resolution System

All actions in The Expanse RPG are resolved using a consistent core mechanic:

**Basic Roll:**
- Roll three six-sided dice (3d6)
- One die is visually distinct and called the "Drama Die" or "Stunt Die"
- Add relevant modifiers (ability scores, focuses, situational bonuses)
- Compare total to Target Number (TN)
- If total equals or exceeds TN, the action succeeds

**Target Numbers (TNs):**
- **TN 7-9:** Routine tasks
- **TN 11:** Average difficulty
- **TN 13:** Challenging tasks
- **TN 15:** Hard tasks
- **TN 17+:** Formidable or nearly impossible tasks

### The Stunt System

**Generating Stunts:**
- When any two dice show the same number (doubles), you generate stunt points
- The value shown on the Drama Die becomes your stunt points for that action
- Example: Rolling 4, 4, 6 with the Drama Die showing 6 gives you 6 stunt points

**Using Stunt Points:**
- Spend stunt points immediately on special effects or benefits
- Different stunt tables exist for: combat, social encounters, exploration, spaceship actions
- Stunts create cinematic, dramatic results beyond simple success

**Common Stunt Options:**
- **Combat:** Extra damage, special maneuvers, tactical positioning
- **Social:** Influence multiple targets, gain additional information, change attitudes
- **Exploration:** Discover hidden details, move faster, avoid complications
- **Spaceship:** System-specific effects, evasive maneuvers, targeting subsystems

## Character Creation

### Nine Abilities

Characters have nine core abilities that define their capabilities:

1. **Accuracy** - Ranged combat, shooting, throwing
2. **Communication** - Social interaction, persuasion, leadership
3. **Constitution** - Health, endurance, resistance to conditions
4. **Dexterity** - Agility, stealth, fine manipulation
5. **Fighting** - Melee combat, brawling, close quarters
6. **Intelligence** - Knowledge, reasoning, technical skills
7. **Perception** - Awareness, observation, insight
8. **Strength** - Physical power, carrying capacity, brute force
9. **Willpower** - Mental fortitude, determination, resisting influence

**Ability Generation:**
- Roll 3d6 for each ability
- May swap two scores to better fit character concept
- Abilities range from 0-5+ (average human is 1-2)

### Focuses

Focuses are specialized skills tied to abilities, representing specific areas of expertise:

**Examples:**
- **Intelligence (Technology)** - Computer systems, electronics, hacking
- **Communication (Persuasion)** - Convincing, negotiating, influencing
- **Dexterity (Pilot)** - Spacecraft operation, maneuvering, navigation

- Disciplined, regimented culture

**The Belt (Belter)**
- Space station dwellers and asteroid miners
- Adapted to low/zero gravity
- Blue-collar, resourceful culture
- Disadvantages: Struggle in high gravity (Earth/Mars)

### Social Class & Background

**Social Classes:**
- **Lower Class** - Working poor, basic assistance recipients
- **Middle Class** - Stable employment, comfortable living
- **Upper Class** - Wealthy, influential, connected

Each class provides background options that grant:
- Ability increases
- Focuses or talents
- Narrative flavor and connections

**Example Backgrounds:**

- **Income 4-5:** Middle class, comfortable lifestyle
- **Income 6-8:** Upper class, wealthy and well-connected
- **Income 9+:** Extremely wealthy, influential elite

---

## Fortune System

Instead of traditional hit points, The Expanse RPG uses **Fortune Points**:

**What Fortune Represents:**
- Luck, narrow escapes, and determination
- Not physical health directly
- Ablative protection against danger

**Using Fortune:**
- **Spend 1 Fortune:** Change the value of one die you just rolled
  - Can create doubles to generate stunt points
  - Can turn failure into success
  - Tactical resource management
- **Absorb Damage:** Reduce incoming damage by spending Fortune
- **Avoid Conditions:** Prevent negative status effects

**Fortune Depletion:**
- When Fortune runs low, characters become vulnerable
- At 0 Fortune, characters take real injuries (Conditions)
- Recovery: Rest, interludes, medical care

**Strategic Implications:**
- Managing Fortune is crucial for survival
- Risk vs. reward decisions in every scene
- Creates tension without tracking detailed health

---

## Conditions System

When Fortune can't protect you, characters suffer **Conditions**:

**Condition Types:**

**Injuries:**
- **Hurt** - Minor injury, -1 penalty to tests
- **Injured** - Serious wound, -2 penalty to tests
- **Wounded** - Grievous injury, -3 penalty to tests

**Fatigue:**
- **Fatigued** - Tired, -1 penalty to tests
- **Exhausted** - Near collapse, -2 penalty to tests

**Mental/Social:**
- **Demoralized** - Loss of confidence
- **Rattled** - Shaken by events
- **Panicked** - Loss of composure

**Tactical:**
- **Hindered** - Movement or action restricted

- **Blind** - Cannot see

**Recovery:**
- Short rest can clear minor conditions
- Medical attention helps moderate conditions
- Serious conditions require significant downtime

---

## The Churn System

**The Churn** is a unique GM tool representing chaos and complications:

**How It Works:**
- GM tracks The Churn on a meter (typically 0-30+)
- Player actions increase The Churn:
  - Risky decisions
  - Public displays of power
  - Breaking laws or social norms
  - Major successes that attract attention

**Churn Triggers:**
- At specific thresholds (e.g., 10, 20, 30), complications occur
- GM introduces unexpected events:
  - Rival factions appear
  - Authority figures investigate
  - Equipment fails at critical moments
  - Deadlines accelerate
  - Third parties interfere

**Purpose:**
- Creates dynamic, reactive world
- Maintains tension without arbitrary time limits
- Rewards careful vs. bold play differently
- True to source material's unpredictable nature

**Example from "The Whispering Signal":**
- Churn 10: Rival crew shadows players
- Churn 20: Martian patrol demands identification
- Churn 30: Third-party interceptor arrives
