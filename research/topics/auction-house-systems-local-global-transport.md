## Research Question

How should auction house systems be designed for MMORPGs, considering the tradeoffs between local vs global markets, physical transport mechanics with security and ambush gameplay, player-run auction services, postal/courier systems, and lessons from historical real-world auction and delivery systems?

**Research Context:**  
BlueMarble's planet-scale MMORPG requires an auction house system that balances player convenience with realistic geological constraints and meaningful trade gameplay. This research examines auction house architectures, transport mechanics, security systems, player-run services, and draws insights from both virtual world implementations and historical real-world auction, postal, and courier systems including their security measures.

---

## Executive Summary

This research investigates auction house design through five critical dimensions:

1. **Local vs Global Market Architecture** - Regional markets create emergent gameplay and specialization, while global markets prioritize convenience
2. **Physical Transport Mechanics** - Movement of goods affects market behavior, prices, and creates trade route gameplay
3. **Historical Real-World Examples** - Lessons from commodity exchanges, art auctions, and historical trading systems
4. **Security and Ambush Mechanics** - Physical realization of auctions with transport security, guards, and risk-based gameplay
5. **Player-Run Services** - Player auctioneers, couriers, and delivery systems alongside NPC options

**Key Finding:**  
Hybrid auction systems that combine local markets with physical transport requirements create the most engaging economic gameplay. Regional specialization drives trade, while transport mechanics add risk/reward dynamics and prevent instant arbitrage exploitation. Player-run auction and courier services create viable professions while competing with NPC services.

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**  
Implement tiered regional auction houses (neighborhood to global) with fee structures based on zone size. Support both NPC and player-run auction services. Include physical transport with security tiers from minimal guards to military convoys. Integrate postal/courier delivery systems with insurance options. Allow ambush mechanics on valuable transports to create risk-based gameplay.

  visibility: Can see all market listings
  transaction: Must be physically present
  delivery: Manual transport required
  
benefits:
  - Information accessibility (QoL)
  - Physical constraint (gameplay)
  - Trade route emergence (depth)
  - Regional specialization (strategy)
```

## Part II: Physical Transport Mechanics

### 1. Transport System Requirements

**Core Design Principles:**
```yaml
realism_constraints:
  - Items have weight and volume
  - Player carrying capacity limited
  - Vehicles required for bulk transport
  - Terrain affects travel speed and routes
  - Distance matters economically

gameplay_balance:
  - Transport time investment proportional to profit
  - Risk scales with cargo value
  - Multiple transport methods available
  - Specialization in logistics viable
  - Solo and group transport both valid
```

**Transport Methods by Scale:**

        demand_modifier = local_consumption / (local_production + 0.01)
        demand_modifier = min(demand_modifier, 2.0)  # Cap at 2x
        
        # Calculate final price
        base_price = global_avg * supply_modifier * demand_modifier
        
        # Add some randomness for market dynamics
        variance = random.uniform(0.95, 1.05)

## Part VI: Historical Auction Systems and Security

### 1. Historical Real-World Auction Types

**Roman Gladiator and Slave Auctions:**

```yaml
historical_context:
  period: Ancient Rome (753 BC - 476 AD)
  locations: Forum Romanum, regional slave markets
  
auction_mechanics:
  gladiator_auctions:
    - Auctioned to ludus (gladiator schools)
    - Physical inspection allowed
    - Combat record displayed
    - Price based on skill, victories, crowd appeal
    - Ascending bid auction format
    
  slave_auctions:
    - Public display on raised platforms
    - Skills and origin advertised
    - Physical examination permitted
    - Age, health, training documented
    - Sale by outcry (verbal bidding)

security_measures:
  - Armed guards (vigiles) present
  - Chains and restraints on subjects
  - Quick transaction completion
  - Payment verification immediate
  - Transfer of ownership documented

bluemarble_ethical_adaptation:
  - Historical mechanics WITHOUT unethical content
  - Apply auction format to NPC contracts
  - Use security escort mechanics
  - Public display platform design
  - Bidding competition systems
  
note: |
  BlueMarble will NOT include slavery or unethical trading.
  We study these historical systems purely for their MECHANICAL
  auction formats, security arrangements, and public bidding
  dynamics, which can be ethically applied to goods, resources,
  and NPC service contracts.
```

**Application to BlueMarble (Ethical Adaptation):**

```python

**Medieval Guild Auctions:**

```yaml
historical_context:
  period: Medieval Europe (500-1500 AD)

  guild_controlled:
    - Members-only bidding

**Strategic Zone Selection:**

```yaml
player_strategy:
  common_items:
    recommended_zone: neighborhood or city
    reasoning: |
      Low value items don't justify high listing fees.
      Local buyers sufficient for commodity goods.
      Quick turnover more important than max price.
    
  specialized_items:
    recommended_zone: regional or national
    reasoning: |
      Need larger buyer pool to find interested parties.
      Specialized knowledge concentrated in certain regions.
      Worth paying higher fee for right buyer.
    
  rare_items:
    recommended_zone: continental or global
    reasoning: |
      Very few potential buyers exist.
      Maximum exposure needed to find collectors.
      High value justifies premium listing fees.
      Competition between wealthy buyers drives price up.

cross_listing:
  strategy: List in multiple zones simultaneously
  benefit: Maximize exposure
  cost: Pay multiple listing fees
  suitable_for: Valuable items where exposure matters
  
  example:
    item: Legendary geological sample (first of its kind)
    zones: [continental, global]
    listing_fees: 3000 + 10000 = 13000 credits
    expected_sale: 500000+ credits
    roi: High - worth the investment for unique item
