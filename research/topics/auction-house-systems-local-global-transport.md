## Research Question

How should auction house systems be designed for MMORPGs, considering the tradeoffs between local vs global markets, physical transport mechanics, and lessons from historical real-world auction systems?

**Research Context:**  
BlueMarble's planet-scale MMORPG requires an auction house system that balances player convenience with realistic geological constraints and meaningful trade gameplay. This research examines auction house architectures, transport mechanics, and draws insights from both virtual world implementations and historical real-world auction systems.

---

## Executive Summary

This research investigates auction house design through three critical dimensions:

1. **Local vs Global Market Architecture** - Regional markets create emergent gameplay and specialization, while global markets prioritize convenience
2. **Physical Transport Mechanics** - Movement of goods affects market behavior, prices, and creates trade route gameplay
3. **Historical Real-World Examples** - Lessons from commodity exchanges, art auctions, and historical trading systems

**Key Finding:**  
Hybrid auction systems that combine local markets with physical transport requirements create the most engaging economic gameplay. Regional specialization drives trade, while transport mechanics add risk/reward dynamics and prevent instant arbitrage exploitation.

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**  
Implement regional auction houses tied to geological resource distribution, with physical transport mechanics that respect terrain constraints. Allow global search visibility but require physical presence for transactions, creating natural trade network gameplay.

    - Geography knowledge critical
```

### 3. Hybrid Systems (Recommended for BlueMarble)

**Definition:** Regional markets with global search capability but physical transport requirements.

**Design Philosophy:**
```yaml
core_principle: "Search globally, trade locally, transport physically"

implementation:
  search: Global database queries
  visibility: Can see all market listings
  transaction: Must be physically present
  delivery: Manual transport required
  
benefits:
  - Information accessibility (QoL)
  - Physical constraint (gameplay)
  - Trade route emergence (depth)
  - Regional specialization (strategy)
```

## Part II: Physical Transport Mechanics

### 1. Transport System Requirements

**Core Design Principles:**
```yaml
realism_constraints:
  - Items have weight and volume
  - Player carrying capacity limited
  - Vehicles required for bulk transport
  - Terrain affects travel speed and routes
  - Distance matters economically

gameplay_balance:
  - Transport time investment proportional to profit
  - Risk scales with cargo value
  - Multiple transport methods available
  - Specialization in logistics viable
  - Solo and group transport both valid
```

**Transport Methods by Scale:**

        demand_modifier = local_consumption / (local_production + 0.01)
        demand_modifier = min(demand_modifier, 2.0)  # Cap at 2x
        
        # Calculate final price
        base_price = global_avg * supply_modifier * demand_modifier
        
        # Add some randomness for market dynamics
        variance = random.uniform(0.95, 1.05)
