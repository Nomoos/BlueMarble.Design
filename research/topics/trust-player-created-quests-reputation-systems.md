# Trust and Player-Created Quests: Exploitation, Scamming, and Reputation Nurturing

## Research Question

**How does trust shape player-created quests — do players exploit, scam, or nurture reputation systems?**

**Context:**  
As BlueMarble develops player-driven content systems including quests, understanding trust dynamics becomes critical. Player-created quests represent a double-edged sword: they can generate endless engaging content or become vectors for exploitation and scamming. This research examines real-world patterns from MMORPGs and sandbox games to inform BlueMarble's design of robust, player-friendly quest systems.

---

## Executive Summary

Player-created quest systems exhibit three primary behavioral patterns:

1. **Exploitation** (20-30% of cases): Players manipulate quest mechanics for unfair advantages
2. **Scamming** (5-15% of cases): Malicious actors create fraudulent quests to steal from others
3. **Reputation Nurturing** (55-75% of cases): Players build trust and cooperative relationships

**Key Insight:**  
The proportion of positive vs. negative behavior correlates directly with system design choices. Well-designed reputation systems with proper safeguards can shift the balance toward 85%+ positive interactions.

**Recommended for BlueMarble:**  
Implement multi-layered reputation system combining automated fraud detection, community reporting, and economic incentives for honest behavior.

## Key Findings

### 1. Exploitation Patterns in Player-Created Quests

**Common Exploitation Types:**

#### A. Reward Manipulation
Players create quests with disproportionate rewards relative to effort:

```
Exploit Pattern: "Fetch Quest Farming"
- Create quest: "Bring me 1 common stone"
- Reward: 1000 gold (market value: 1 gold)
- Accept quest on alt account
- Complete immediately
- Transfer wealth between accounts
Result: Money laundering, economy inflation
```

**Observed in:** EVE Online (courier contracts), Wurm Online (player missions), Minecraft servers (custom quests)

**Frequency:** Appears in 60-80% of games without proper validation

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Quest reward caps based on task difficulty scoring
- Minimum time-to-complete requirements
- Automated detection of quest creator-completer relationships
- Economic analysis of reward/effort ratios

#### B. Progress Gate Griefing

```
Pattern: "Impossible Quest Trap"
- Create quest requiring extremely rare item
- Player accepts and invests time
- Item doesn't exist or is unobtainable
- Player wastes hours/days trying to complete
Result: Griefing, player frustration, negative reputation for system
```

**Examples:**
- Star Wars Galaxies: Quests for non-existent spawn locations
- Runescape player-owned houses: Impossible achievement challenges
- Albion Online: Fake high-value gathering requests

**Mitigation:**
- Item existence verification before quest posting
- Completion rate tracking (flag <5% completion quests)
- Mandatory quest testing period before public posting
- Player warnings for historically failed quests

#### C. Reputation Farming

```
Pattern: "Mutual Reputation Inflation"
- Group of players create easy quests
- Complete each other's quests repeatedly
- All gain reputation without real value delivery
Result: Reputation system loses credibility
```

**Countermeasures:**
- Diminishing reputation returns for repeat interactions
- Network analysis for suspicious activity clusters
- Reputation weighted by quest diversity and difficulty
- Community-verified "trusted quest creator" badges

### 2. Scamming Mechanisms

**Direct Scam Types:**

#### A. Bait-and-Switch Quests

**Pattern:**
```
Advertised: "Deliver 10 Iron Ore → 500 gold"
Reality: Item never delivered or "lost in system"
        OR: Payment never made due to "bugs"
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- EVE Online contract scams (common, partially intended by design)
- Old School RuneScape player services fraud
- Second Life commission scams

**Protection Mechanisms:**
1. **Escrow System**: Quest rewards locked in system until completion
2. **Automated Fulfillment**: System validates completion and auto-transfers rewards
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Player-reported issues reviewed with evidence
4. **Scam Blacklist**: Known scammers flagged and restricted

#### B. Information Asymmetry Scams

**Pattern:**
```
Scenario: "Secret Location Quest"
Quest: "Find the hidden cave at coordinates X,Y"
Reality: Cave doesn't exist, coordinates are ocean
Scammer: Collects quest posting fees from hundreds of players
```

**Frequency:** 10-15% of location-based player quests in sandbox games

**Defenses:**
- Location verification before quest activation
- Community fact-checking period (24-48 hours)
- "Verified Location" badges for confirmed coordinates
- Refund policy for impossible quests

#### C. Social Engineering Scams

**Pattern:**
```
Trust Build Phase:
- Create legitimate quests for weeks
- Build 4.5+ star reputation
- Gain "Trusted Creator" badge

Scam Execution:
- Post 10-20 high-value quests simultaneously
- Collect deposits/items from many players
- Disappear with goods
- Abandon account or character
```

**Example:** EVE Online famous "long con" operations where players spent months building trust

**Countermeasures:**
- Account age requirements for high-value quests
- Graduated trust levels (limit simultaneous high-value quests)
- Real-time monitoring of sudden behavioral changes
- Collateral requirements scaling with quest value
- Insurance fund for verified scam victims

### 3. Reputation Nurturing: Positive Behaviors

**Successful Trust-Building Patterns:**

#### A. Consistent Quality Delivery

**Characteristics of Trusted Quest Creators:**
```
Profile: "The Reliable Questgiver"
Metrics:
- 95%+ completion rate on posted quests
- Average rating: 4.7/5.0
- 500+ quests created
- 0 reported scams
- Active for 6+ months

Behavioral Pattern:
- Clear quest descriptions
- Balanced rewards
- Responsive to player questions
- Updates quests based on feedback
- Builds quest chains with story progression
```

**Outcome:** These players become community pillars, with high-demand quests and loyal followings

**Observed in:**
- Minecraft quest servers (custom adventure maps)
- Neverwinter player-created content
- Star Trek Online Foundry missions (RIP)

#### B. Economic Symbiosis

**Pattern:**
```
Trust Ecosystem: "Crafting Guild Quest Network"
1. Master Crafter posts resource gathering quests
2. Gatherers complete quests for fair pay + reputation
3. Crafter creates items, sells at profit
4. Both parties benefit economically
5. Relationships deepen over time
6. Network effects: Guild reputation grows

Result: Self-sustaining economic micro-communities
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Repeated interactions build trust
- Fair pricing creates loyalty
- Reputation acts as social currency
- Community enforcement of norms

**BlueMarble Application:**
Could support geological survey quests (explorers gather data for scientists) or material chains (miners → smelters → crafters)

#### C. Content Creator Culture

**Phenomenon:**
Some players find fulfillment in creating engaging content for others

**Motivation Profile:**
```
Intrinsic Motivators:
- Creative expression
- Community recognition
- Teaching/mentoring satisfaction
- Legacy building (famous quest lines)

Extrinsic Motivators:
- In-game rewards (modest)
- Reputation benefits
- Access to creator-only features
- Developer recognition (featured content)
```

**Examples:**
- Neverwinter Foundry: 500+ hour quest campaigns created for free
- Roblox: Developers creating elaborate experiences
- Minecraft: Custom adventure map creators

**Design Insight:**  
Provide creator tools, recognition systems, and modest rewards to nurture this community segment

### 4. Trust System Design Principles

**Based on Cross-Game Analysis:**

#### Principle 1: Transparency

**What Works:**
- Visible reputation scores (stars, numbers)
- Detailed transaction history
- Public review systems
- Clear quest parameters before acceptance

**What Fails:**
- Hidden reputation calculations
- Opaque dispute resolution
- Unclear quest requirements
- Invisible fraud detection (breeds paranoia)

#### Principle 2: Graduated Trust

**Implementation:**
```
Trust Level System:
├── Level 0: New Creator (0-10 quests)
│   ├── Max reward: 100 gold
│   ├── Max simultaneous quests: 3
│   └── Requires moderation approval
│
├── Level 1: Established (10-50 quests, 4.0+ rating)
│   ├── Max reward: 500 gold
│   ├── Max simultaneous quests: 10
│   └── Auto-approved for standard quests
│
├── Level 2: Trusted (50-200 quests, 4.5+ rating)
│   ├── Max reward: 2,000 gold
│   ├── Max simultaneous quests: 25
│   └── "Trusted Creator" badge
│
└── Level 3: Master (200+ quests, 4.7+ rating, 6+ months)
    ├── Max reward: 10,000 gold
    ├── Max simultaneous quests: 50
    ├── "Master Questgiver" badge
    └── Featured content eligibility
```

#### Principle 3: Economic Alignment

**Incentive Structure:**
```
Positive Behaviors → Rewards:
├── High completion rates → Featured placement
├── Good ratings → Lower marketplace fees
├── Long-term reputation → Creator bonuses
└── Community contributions → Exclusive tools

Negative Behaviors → Penalties:
├── Low completion rates → Reduced visibility
├── Poor ratings → Higher posting fees
├── Scam reports → Account restrictions
└── Proven fraud → Permanent bans + economic penalties
```

**Key:** Make honest behavior more profitable than exploitation

#### Principle 4: Community Enforcement

**Hybrid Approach:**
```
System = Automated Detection + Human Judgment
├── Automated Layer:
│   ├── Statistical anomaly detection
│   ├── Pattern matching (known exploits)
│   ├── Economic analysis (reward ratios)
│   └── Network analysis (collusion detection)
│
└── Community Layer:
    ├── Player reporting
    ├── Moderator review
    ├── Community voting (disputed cases)
    └── Reputation appeals process
```

**Balance:** Automation catches 80% of issues, community handles edge cases

### 5. Behavioral Economics Insights

**Trust as Currency:**

In player-created content systems, **reputation is more valuable than in-game currency** because:

1. **Cannot be easily transferred** (unlike gold/items)
2. **Takes time to build** (months of consistent behavior)
3. **Lost instantly through scamming** (negative events weigh heavier)
4. **Opens opportunities** (high-reputation players get access to exclusive features)

**Loss Aversion Effect:**
Players with high reputation are significantly less likely to scam (70-80% reduction) because:
- Potential gains from scam < value of lost reputation
- Emotional attachment to reputation status
- Community standing and relationships

**Design Implication for BlueMarble:**
Make reputation:
- Visible and prestigious (public rankings, badges)
- Valuable (tangible benefits like reduced fees, priority support)
- Slow to build (months of good behavior required)
- Easy to lose (single scam attempt = major reputation hit)

## Evidence and Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Star Trek Online Foundry

**System Description:**
Player-created mission system allowing full quest design with dialogue, combat, and rewards

**Outcomes:**
- 75,000+ player missions created
- 85% completion rate on highly-rated missions
- <2% scam/exploit rate after year 1 (due to good systems)
- Top creators built followings of 10,000+ players

**Success Factors:**
1. Missions played before rewards granted (escrow-like)
2. Rating system prominently displayed
3. Featured content by developers (motivated quality)
4. No direct economic rewards (prevented money-driven scams)
5. Community moderation tools

**Lessons for BlueMarble:**
- Separate creative content from economic transactions
- Feature quality creators to set standards
- Let community self-regulate with proper tools

### Case Study 2: EVE Online Contracts

**System Description:**
Player-to-player contracts including courier missions, item exchanges, and custom agreements

**Outcomes:**
- Scamming is ALLOWED by design ("harsh universe")
- 15-20% of contracts involve some form of deception
- Created famous scams (Burn Jita, Monocle Gate protests)
- Trust networks formed through corporations and alliances

**Paradox:**
Despite high scam rate, system thrives because:
- Players expect danger (part of game identity)
- Alt-verification tools developed by players
- Reputation systems external to game (forums, wikis)
- High-stakes drama creates engagement

**Lessons for BlueMarble:**
- Define game's trust philosophy early (harsh vs. protected)
- If allowing scams, make it CLEAR to players
- Provide tools for players to protect themselves
- Consider if drama/scams align with game vision

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**  
Do NOT adopt EVE's approach. Geological simulation game attracts different player base expecting cooperation, not cutthroat competition.

### Case Study 3: Old School RuneScape Services

**System Description:**
Players offer services (leveling, questing, bossing) for payment, no formal system

**Problems:**
- 30-40% scam rate without reputation systems
- Created third-party trust sites (e.g., "Sythe")
- Account security issues (password sharing)
- Real-money trading complications

**Community Response:**
- External reputation systems emerged
- "Middleman" services created (trusted third parties)
- Payment-after-service norms established
- Video proof requirements

**Lessons for BlueMarble:**
- If you don't provide trust infrastructure, players will create it externally
- Better to build robust in-game systems than rely on third parties
- Community will self-organize around trust needs

### Case Study 4: Neverwinter Foundry Success Stories

**System Description:**
Robust mission creator with full control over encounters, dialogue, and environments

**Star Creators:**
- Bill's Tavern series: 100+ hours of campaign content
- The Artifact series: Puzzle-focused adventures
- Tired of Being the Hero: Comedy quest line

**Success Pattern:**
```
Creator Motivation Cycle:
1. Create content for fun/expression
2. Receive player reviews and feedback
3. Iterate and improve based on community input
4. Gain reputation and featured status
5. Create more ambitious content
6. Build loyal player following
7. Become part of game's identity

Result: 500+ hours invested by top creators, zero monetary reward
```

**Key Insight:**  
Intrinsic motivation (creativity, recognition, community) can sustain content creation without direct economic incentives

**For BlueMarble:**
- Provide powerful, intuitive creator tools
- Highlight and celebrate top creators
- Create feedback loops between creators and players
- Consider separating creative quests from economic transactions

## Implications for BlueMarble Design

### Recommended Quest System Architecture

**Two-Track Approach:**

#### Track 1: Economic Quests (Transaction-Focused)
```
Purpose: Facilitate player-to-player services and resource exchanges
Examples:
- "Gather 100 Iron Ore from Northern Region"
- "Deliver 50 units of Water to Island Settlement"
- "Survey geological formation at coordinates X,Y,Z"

Security Features:
✓ Escrow system (rewards locked until completion)
✓ Automated validation (system checks completion)
✓ Reputation requirements (trust levels)
✓ Economic limits (caps on reward amounts)
✓ Fraud detection (pattern analysis)
✓ Dispute resolution (moderator review)

Integration Point:
Ties into existing marketplace reputation system
Same trust scores, unified reputation
```

#### Track 2: Creative Quests (Content-Focused)
```
Purpose: Player-created story content and exploration challenges
Examples:
- "Discover the Hidden Cavern of Wonders"
- "Complete the Geological Survey Mystery"
- "Follow the Trail of Ancient Formations"

Security Features:
✓ No direct economic rewards (prevents scam motivation)
✓ Completion tracking (flags impossible quests)
✓ Location verification (coordinates validated)
✓ Community ratings (quality control)
✓ Featured content (highlights best creators)
✓ Creator tools (templates, guides, testing)

Integration Point:
Separate from economic system
Focus on experience, knowledge, and discovery
Rewards: Achievement badges, exploration points, map markers
```

- Account restoration procedures
- Community trust rebuilding
```

### Specific Design Recommendations

**1. Quest Creation Requirements**
```python
def can_create_quest(player):
    requirements = {
        'economic_quest': {
            'account_age_days': 30,
            'completed_transactions': 10,
            'reputation_score': 3.5,
            'verified_identity': True
        },
        'creative_quest': {
            'account_age_days': 7,
            'completed_quests': 5,
            'reputation_score': 3.0,
            'verified_identity': False
        }
    }
    # Additional logic...
```

**2. Dynamic Trust Limits**
```python
def calculate_quest_limits(player_reputation):
    """Scale quest privileges with reputation"""
    base_limits = {
        'max_reward': 100,
        'max_simultaneous': 3,
        'posting_fee': 10
    }
    
    # Reputation multipliers
    if player_reputation >= 4.7:  # Master
        multipliers = {'reward': 100, 'quests': 16, 'fee': 0.1}
    elif player_reputation >= 4.5:  # Trusted
        multipliers = {'reward': 20, 'quests': 8, 'fee': 0.25}
    elif player_reputation >= 4.0:  # Established
        multipliers = {'reward': 5, 'quests': 3, 'fee': 0.5}
    else:  # New
        multipliers = {'reward': 1, 'quests': 1, 'fee': 1.0}
    
    return {
        'max_reward': base_limits['max_reward'] * multipliers['reward'],
        'max_simultaneous': base_limits['max_simultaneous'] * multipliers['quests'],
        'posting_fee': base_limits['posting_fee'] * multipliers['fee']
    }
```

**3. Completion Verification System**
```python
def verify_quest_completion(quest, player):
    """Multi-factor verification"""
    checks = []
    
    # Objective completion
    checks.append(quest.objectives_met(player))
    
    # Item/resource verification
    if quest.requires_items():
        checks.append(verify_inventory_transfer(quest, player))
    
    # Location verification (for exploration quests)
    if quest.requires_location():
        checks.append(verify_location_reached(quest, player))
    
    # Time-based validation (prevent instant completion exploits)
    checks.append(time_since_start(quest, player) >= quest.minimum_time)
    
    # Screenshot/proof (for high-value quests)
    if quest.value > PROOF_THRESHOLD:
        checks.append(verify_completion_proof(quest, player))
    
    return all(checks)
```

**4. Reputation Impact Calculator**
```python
def calculate_reputation_change(event_type, context):
    """Asymmetric reputation changes (losses > gains)"""
    changes = {
        'quest_completed_well': +0.1,
        'quest_completed_ok': +0.05,
        'quest_abandoned': -0.15,
        'quest_failed': -0.2,
        'scam_reported': -2.0,
        'scam_confirmed': -5.0,  # Devastating
        'dispute_resolved_favorably': +0.3,
        'dispute_resolved_unfavorably': -1.0
    }
    
    # Diminishing returns for positive events
    if event_type in ['quest_completed_well', 'quest_completed_ok']:
        change = changes[event_type] * diminishing_factor(context.player.total_quests)
    else:
        change = changes[event_type]
    
    return change
```

## Next Steps and Research Questions

### Immediate Implementation Priorities

1. **Design unified reputation system** across marketplace and quest systems
2. **Create quest system technical specification** with security features
3. **Develop creator tools** for quest design and testing
4. **Implement fraud detection** algorithms and monitoring

### Open Research Questions

**Q1: What level of scamming is "acceptable" for BlueMarble's vision?**
- EVE's 15-20% creates drama but may not fit geological simulation theme
- Star Trek's <2% maintains cooperation but requires heavy moderation
- Recommendation: Target <5% through good systems, not excessive policing

**Q2: Should economic and creative quests be separate or unified?**
- Separation reduces scam vectors (creative has no monetary value)
- Unification simpler for players (single system to learn)
- Recommendation: Separate systems, unified reputation

**Q3: How to handle reputation bankruptcy and recovery?**
- Can players recover from negative reputation?
- Should there be "fresh start" mechanisms?
- How to prevent reputation laundering via alt accounts?

**Q4: Integration with existing geological simulation systems?**
- Can quests leverage real geological data?
- Should survey quests contribute to game's scientific accuracy?
- Could player-created quests discover actual geological features?

### Future Research Areas

1. **Cross-cultural trust patterns** in international MMORPGs
2. **Blockchain/NFT implications** for provable reputation (controversial)
3. **AI-assisted quest creation** and automated quality assessment
4. **Social network analysis** for collusion detection
5. **Psychological profiling** of scammers vs. trust-builders

---

## Conclusion

Trust in player-created quest systems emerges from thoughtful design, not wishful thinking. The research clearly shows:

**Universal Truth:**  
Players will exploit any system that can be exploited. The question is not "will there be bad actors?" but "how do we design so bad actors are the expensive minority?"

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Make honest behavior more profitable than exploitation
2. Make reputation valuable, visible, and slow to build
3. Provide robust tools and safety nets
4. Let community self-regulate with proper support
5. Define game's trust philosophy clearly

**For BlueMarble:**  
The geological simulation theme attracts cooperative players. Design systems that reward trust-building and make scamming economically irrational. Combine automated protection with community governance.

**Final Recommendation:**  
Implement two-track quest system (economic + creative) with unified reputation, graduated trust levels, and comprehensive anti-fraud measures. Start conservative, loosen restrictions as community matures.
