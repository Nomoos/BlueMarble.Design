# Spatial Analysis: Generalization Tools

## Problem / Context

BlueMarble's massive planetary scale requires efficient representation at multiple resolutions. Generalization tools reduce data complexity while preserving essential characteristics, enabling smooth level-of-detail transitions and manageable data sizes.

This research examines spatial generalization techniques to inform BlueMarble's LOD (Level of Detail) system and data simplification strategies.

## Key Findings

- **Aggregation**: Combines adjacent cells into larger units
  - Sum, mean, median, maximum, minimum operators
  - Creates coarser resolution from fine detail
  - Preserves statistical properties at larger scale
  - Essential for multi-resolution hierarchies

- **Boundary Clean**: Smooths jagged edges and removes small gaps
  - Expands/contracts regions to eliminate noise
  - Removes small polygon holes and slivers
  - Priority parameter controls aggressiveness
  - Maintains general shape while reducing complexity

- **Majority Filter**: Replaces cells with most common neighbor value
  - Removes isolated cells and salt-and-pepper noise
  - Options: 4-neighbor or 8-neighbor connectivity
  - Multiple passes for stronger smoothing
  - Preserves dominant patterns while eliminating outliers

- **Region Group**: Identifies contiguous regions of same value
  - Labels connected cells with unique IDs
  - Used before filtering small regions
  - Options: 4-way or 8-way connectivity
  - Foundation for size-based simplification

## Evidence

### Source 1: Generalization Toolset Overview

- **Link**: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.4/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/an-overview-of-the-generalization-tools.htm
- **Key Points**:
  - Tools include: Aggregate, Boundary Clean, Expand, Majority Filter, Nibble, Region Group, Shrink, Thin
  - Two categories: statistical (aggregate) and morphological (boundary operations)
  - Critical for reducing data volume while preserving patterns
  - Often used in preprocessing pipelines
- **Relevance**: Complete toolkit for multi-resolution terrain management

### Source 2: Aggregate Function

- **Link**: (ArcGIS standard documentation)
- **Key Points**:
  - Combines NxN cell blocks into single cell
  - Aggregation factor: 2, 3, 4, etc. (power of 2 most efficient)
  - Statistics: Mean for elevation, Mode for categories, Sum for accumulation
  - Cell alignment matters for consistent hierarchies
- **Relevance**: Core operation for building terrain LOD pyramid

### Source 3: Majority Filter

- **Link**: (ArcGIS standard documentation)
- **Key Points**:
  - Replaces each cell with most frequent neighbor value
  - Number_of_neighbors: FOUR (orthogonal) or EIGHT (including diagonals)
  - Replacement: MAJORITY (>50%) or HALF (â‰¥50%)
  - Multiple iterations increase smoothing strength
- **Relevance**: Noise reduction for categorical terrain data (biomes, materials)

### Data/Observations

- Generalization trade-offs:
  - Loss of fine detail vs reduced data size
  - Smoother appearance vs loss of characteristic roughness
  - Faster rendering vs lower visual quality
  - Global consistency vs local accuracy

- Order of operations matters:
  1. Remove noise (Majority Filter)
  2. Clean boundaries (Boundary Clean)
  3. Aggregate to coarser resolution
  4. Repeat for next LOD level

- Aggregation strategy affects results:
  - Mean elevation: smooths terrain, reduces peaks
  - Max elevation: preserves peaks, creates stepped appearance
  - Median elevation: robust to outliers, balances smoothness

## Implications for Design

- **LOD Pyramid**: Pre-compute multiple resolution levels
  - Level 0: Full resolution (e.g., 1m grid)
  - Level 1: 2x aggregate (2m grid)
  - Level 2: 4x aggregate (4m grid)
  - Level n: 2^n aggregate
  - Impact: Smooth zoom with predictable performance

- **Material Simplification**: Generalize material types at distance
  - Close view: Full material diversity (50+ types)
  - Medium view: Grouped materials (10-15 categories)
  - Far view: Major biomes only (5-7 types)
  - Impact: Reduced texture switching and draw calls

- **Streaming Strategy**: Load appropriate LOD based on distance
  - Camera distance determines required resolution
  - Pre-generalized data avoids runtime computation
  - Seamless transitions using geomorphing/blending
  - Impact: Scalable to planetary distances

- **Storage Optimization**: Hierarchical storage structure
  - Quadtree/Octree nodes store aggregated data
  - Parent nodes cache generalized versions
  - Only leaf nodes need full detail
  - Impact: Efficient memory usage and cache coherency

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### Open Questions

- What aggregation method best preserves terrain character (mean vs median vs something custom)?
- How many LOD levels do we need for seamless planetary to local-scale viewing?
- Should we support different generalization strategies per biome type?
- How do we handle discontinuities (roads, walls) that shouldn't be smoothed?

### Next Steps

- [ ] Implement aggregation algorithm for test terrain patch
- [ ] Compare visual quality of different aggregation methods
- [ ] Design LOD transition system with blending/geomorphing
- [ ] Measure storage size at different LOD levels
- [ ] Profile rendering performance across LOD ranges
