## Research Question

**What is the optimal ratio of hand-crafted, template-based, procedural, and UGC quest content
specifically for BlueMarble's geological sandbox MMORPG?**

**Research Context:**

While previous research established general guidelines (15% structured, 30% semi-structured, 55%
optional), and content generation strategies (hand-crafted, templates, UGC, procedural), this
research determines the specific optimal balance for BlueMarble's unique geological simulation
environment and target player base.

---

## Executive Summary

Research indicates that **BlueMarble's optimal content distribution is: 12% hand-crafted, 45%
template-based, 25% UGC, 18% procedural**, differing from general sandbox recommendations due to
geological complexity and educational focus.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Geological Complexity Reduces UGC Share** - Scientific accuracy limits casual creators
2. **Template Systems Excel** - Simulation provides authentic variety from templates
3. **Hand-Crafted Focus on Onboarding** - More concentrated than typical sandboxes
4. **Procedural Supplements, Not Replaces** - Fills gaps without dominating

**Critical Insight for BlueMarble:**

Geological simulation is both an advantage (templates create authentic challenges) and constraint
(limits UGC accessibility), requiring unique content balance different from typical sandbox games.

   - Build 5 templates, 20 hand-crafted, UGC tool, procedural system
   - Test with 100 players for 2 weeks
   - Measure engagement and satisfaction
   - Adjust ratios based on data

2. **Establish Metrics Dashboard**
   - Track completion rates by type
   - Monitor satisfaction scores
   - Watch economic indicators
   - Set up automated alerts

3. **Plan Content Production Pipeline**
   - Allocate team resources to match ratios
   - Create production schedule
   - Build quality assurance process
   - Setup community moderation

### Open Questions

1. **Seasonal Variations**: Should ratios shift for events/seasons?
2. **Expansion Impact**: How do expansions affect long-term balance?
3. **Player Retention**: Does balance affect different retention cohorts differently?
4. **Competitive Balance**: How does PvP (if any) interact with quest distribution?

## Conclusion

**Research Answer:**

**BlueMarble's optimal content distribution is: 12% hand-crafted, 45% template-based, 25% UGC,
18% procedural**, totaling $353K investment for 5,550-15,050 quests at launch.

**Why This Specific Balance:**

1. ✅ **45% Templates** - Higher than typical due to geological simulation advantage
2. ✅ **25% UGC** - Lower than typical due to scientific complexity constraint
3. ✅ **12% Hand-Crafted** - Focused on essentials (tutorials, faction, featured)
4. ✅ **18% Procedural** - Fills gaps without dominating experience

**Key Differentiators from General Sandbox:**

- More templates (simulation creates variety)
- Less UGC (geological expertise barrier)
- Focused hand-crafted (educational quality)
- Moderate procedural (quality over quantity)

**Bottom Line:**

This balance leverages BlueMarble's unique geological simulation strength while accommodating
its scientific accuracy requirements and educational mission, creating sustainable content
ecosystem with manageable development resources.
