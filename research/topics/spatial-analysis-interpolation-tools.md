# Spatial Analysis: Interpolation Tools

## Problem / Context

BlueMarble's procedural world generation needs to create smooth, realistic terrain from sparse data points. Interpolation techniques are essential for filling gaps between known elevation points, generating continuous surfaces, and creating natural-looking terrain transitions.

This research examines spatial interpolation methods used in professional GIS to inform BlueMarble's terrain generation and data densification algorithms.

## Key Findings

- **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)**: Simple, fast interpolation weighted by distance
  - Nearby points have more influence than distant ones
  - Power parameter controls smoothness (typically 2)
  - No assumptions about data distribution
  - Creates "bulls-eye" patterns around sample points

- **Kriging**: Geostatistical method using spatial autocorrelation
  - Optimal unbiased predictor based on semivariogram
  - Provides prediction uncertainty estimates
  - Multiple variants: Ordinary, Universal, Simple, Co-kriging
  - Computationally intensive but highly accurate

- **Spline Interpolation**: Creates smooth surface passing through/near points
  - Regularized spline: allows deviation from exact values
  - Tension spline: controls surface stiffness
  - Ideal for smooth natural features (water surfaces, gentle hills)
  - Can overshoot between points

- **Natural Neighbor**: Weighted average based on Voronoi tessellation
  - Local method using only nearby points
  - Smooth interpolation without extrapolation beyond data extent
  - Adapts to irregular point distributions
  - Good for categorical boundaries

- **Key Points**:
  - Tools include: IDW, Kriging, Natural Neighbor, Spline, Trend, Topo to Raster
  - Each method has different assumptions and characteristics
  - Choice depends on: data density, phenomenon type, accuracy needs
  - Can interpolate any continuous variable (elevation, temperature, pressure)
- **Relevance**: Provides toolkit for all terrain interpolation needs

### Source 2: IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted)

- **Link**: (ArcGIS standard documentation)
- **Key Points**:
  - Formula: Z = Σ(Zi / di^p) / Σ(1 / di^p) where p=power parameter
  - Fast computation: O(n) per output cell for search radius
  - Deterministic method (same inputs → same output)
  - Best for: quick approximations, dense data
- **Relevance**: Fast option for runtime terrain detail generation

### Source 3: Kriging Methods

- **Link**: (ArcGIS geostatistical documentation)
- **Key Points**:
  - Uses semivariogram to model spatial correlation structure
  - Ordinary Kriging: assumes constant unknown mean
  - Universal Kriging: models spatial trend
  - Provides standard error estimates for uncertainty
- **Relevance**: High-quality pre-generation for hero terrain areas

### Data/Observations

- Interpolation quality depends on:
  - Sample density (more points = better accuracy)
  - Distribution pattern (regular grid vs random)
  - Phenomenon characteristics (smooth vs rough)
  - Computational budget (kriging slowest, IDW fastest)

- Common artifacts:
  - IDW: bulls-eye patterns around points
  - Spline: overshooting and oscillation
  - Kriging: edge effects with sparse data
  - Natural Neighbor: flat areas between clusters

## Implications for Design

- **Multi-Scale Terrain**: Use different methods at different scales
  - Planetary scale: Simple IDW for broad features
  - Regional scale: Kriging for important terrain
  - Local scale: Spline for smooth natural features
  - Impact: Balance quality and performance across zoom levels

- **Procedural Generation Pipeline**: Layer interpolation with noise
  - Base elevation from interpolated control points
  - Add fractal noise for natural detail
  - Blend using frequency-based weighting
  - Impact: Realistic terrain with artistic control

- **Runtime Detail**: Fast interpolation for dynamic level-of-detail
  - Cache coarse grid, interpolate fine detail on demand
  - Use IDW with small search radius for speed
  - Transition smoothly between LOD levels
  - Impact: Infinite zoom without precomputing all scales

- **Data Compression**: Store sparse control points, interpolate on load
  - Serialize sample points instead of full height grid
  - Reconstruction error bounded by interpolation quality
  - Adaptive sampling based on terrain roughness
  - Impact: Reduced storage and transmission bandwidth

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### Open Questions

- Which interpolation method best matches our procedural noise characteristics?
- How do we handle discontinuities (cliffs, faults) that shouldn't interpolate smoothly?
- What's the minimum sample density for acceptable terrain quality?
- Should we support user-placed control points for custom terrain editing?

### Next Steps

- [ ] Benchmark IDW vs spline vs kriging performance on test terrain
- [ ] Implement adaptive sampling algorithm (dense in rough areas, sparse in smooth)
- [ ] Design control point format for serialization
- [ ] Prototype terrain editor with manual control point placement
- [ ] Evaluate interpolation artifacts in different biome types
