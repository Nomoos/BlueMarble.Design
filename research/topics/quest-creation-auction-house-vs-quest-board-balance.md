## Research Question

**How does quest creation affect the balance between in-game auction houses vs. quest boards?**

**Research Context:**  
BlueMarble's economy will feature both traditional auction houses (player-to-player item trading) and quest boards (player-generated missions). Understanding how quest creation—both NPC-generated and player-generated—impacts the economic balance between these two systems is critical for maintaining a healthy player economy.

---

## Executive Summary

Quest creation fundamentally shapes the balance between auction houses and quest boards through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Resource Flow Control** - Quests inject resources and currency into the economy, directly affecting auction house supply/demand
2. **Player Incentive Structure** - Quest rewards compete with or complement trading profits, influencing player behavior
3. **Economic Interconnection** - Quest boards can either compete with or enhance auction house activity depending on design

**Key Finding:**  
Quest creation systems must be carefully balanced to ensure quest boards and auction houses function as **complementary economic systems** rather than competing alternatives. When properly designed, quest boards drive auction house activity by creating demand for materials and services, while auction houses provide the resources needed to complete player-generated quests.

**Critical Design Principle:**  
Quest rewards (both NPC and player-generated) should emphasize **non-tradeable progression items** and **currency**, while tradeable materials and crafted goods are primarily obtained through gathering and the auction house. This creates natural economic flow where questing generates purchasing power, and trading provides the goods.

## Understanding the Two Systems

### Auction Houses: Player-to-Player Trading

**Function:** Centralized marketplace where players buy and sell items, resources, and services.

**Economic Role:**
- **Price Discovery** - Market forces determine fair value of goods
- **Resource Distribution** - Moves items from surplus to shortage regions
- **Specialization Support** - Allows players to focus on preferred activities and trade for others
- **Wealth Transfer** - Redistributes currency between players (zero-sum transactions)

**BlueMarble Implementation (from existing research):**
```yaml
auction_house_design:
  type: regional_auction_houses
  transaction_fee: 4%  # Currency sink
  features:
    - price_history_charts
    - supply_demand_indicators
    - regional_price_variations
    - trade_route_opportunities
  
  primary_goods:
    - raw_resources (ores, minerals, samples)
    - crafted_equipment (tools, gear)
    - consumables (food, survival items)
    - rare_discoveries (unique geological samples)
```

### Quest Boards: Player-Generated Missions

**Function:** System where players can create and post quests for other players to complete.

**Economic Role:**
- **Demand Creation** - Players pay for specific services/items they need
- **Work Distribution** - Matches players who need something with those who can provide it
- **Flexible Pricing** - Quest creators set their own reward rates
- **Social Contracts** - Creates direct player-to-player economic relationships

**Typical Quest Board Implementation:**
```yaml
quest_board_design:
  quest_types:
    - gathering_contracts: "Collect 50 iron ore samples"
    - crafting_orders: "Create 10 surveying tools"
    - exploration_requests: "Map the northern mountain region"
    - transport_missions: "Deliver equipment to remote outpost"
    - protection_contracts: "Escort me through dangerous territory"
  
  reward_mechanism:
    - currency_payment: Set by quest creator
    - material_provision: Creator provides materials/tools
    - reputation_gain: System-tracked reliability score
    - item_rewards: Tradeable or non-tradeable items
```

---

## Economic Interaction Mechanisms

### Mechanism 1: Currency Faucets and Flow

**How Quest Creation Affects Currency Supply:**

NPC-generated quests are a **currency faucet** (create new currency):
```yaml
npc_quest_rewards:
  daily_quests: 100-500 TC per quest
  regional_quests: 1000-3000 TC per quest
  discovery_missions: 2000-5000 TC per quest
  
  estimated_daily_injection: 2000-5000 TC per active player
```

This currency flows into the economy and can be spent in two places:
1. **Auction House** - Buying goods from other players
2. **Quest Boards** - Paying other players for services

Player-generated quest boards are **currency neutral** (transfer existing currency):
```yaml
player_quest_transactions:
  # When Player A posts quest for Player B
  scenario:
    - Player A: -1000 TC (payment to Player B)
    - Player B: +950 TC (after 5% system fee)
    - System: +50 TC (quest board fee - currency sink)
  
  net_effect: 
    - Total player currency: -50 TC (minor sink)
    - Wealth redistribution: Player A → Player B
```

**Balance Implication:**

If quest boards offer better rates than auction house trading, players will:
1. Complete NPC quests for currency
2. Use quest boards for all resource acquisition
3. **Bypass the auction house entirely**

This creates a **quest board monopoly** that undermines the auction house economy.

### Mechanism 2: Resource Generation and Distribution

**Quest Rewards as Resource Faucets:**

NPC quests can inject resources into the economy:
```python
def generate_quest_reward(quest_type, difficulty):
    """Generate rewards for NPC quests"""
    rewards = {
        'currency': calculate_currency_reward(difficulty),
        'items': [],
        'progression': []
    }
    
    # DESIGN CHOICE: Should quests reward tradeable items?
    if quest_type == "gathering_tutorial":
        # Option A: Reward tradeable resources (BAD for auction house)
        rewards['items'].append({
            'item': 'iron_ore',
            'quantity': 10,
            'tradeable': True  # Competes with gathered ore on auction house
        })
        
        # Option B: Reward non-tradeable progression (GOOD for balance)
        rewards['progression'].append({
            'type': 'unlock_advanced_survey_tools',
            'tradeable': False  # Doesn't affect auction house supply
        })
    
    return rewards
```

**Critical Balance Point:**

If NPC quests reward **tradeable resources** in significant quantities:
- Players can farm quests for resources instead of gathering
- Quest-generated resources flood the auction house
- Gathering professions become less valuable
- Resource prices crash
- Auction house activity decreases

**Recommended Approach:**
```yaml
quest_reward_design:
  npc_quest_rewards:
    primary:
      - currency (tradeable via quest boards)
      - progression_items (equipment, unlocks - bind on pickup)
      - reputation (faction standing)
      - knowledge (discoveries, recipes)
    
    minimal_or_zero:
      - tradeable_raw_resources
      - tradeable_crafted_goods
      - tradeable_equipment
  
  resource_acquisition:
    primary_sources:
      - gathering_professions → auction_house
      - crafting_professions → auction_house
      - player_quest_boards → commission specific items
```

### Mechanism 3: Opportunity Cost and Player Behavior

Players constantly evaluate: "What's the most profitable activity?"

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario A: Unbalanced - Quest Farming Dominates**
```
Player Decision Matrix:
├── NPC Quest Farming: 500 TC/hour + tradeable items
├── Gathering Resources: 200 TC/hour (via auction house)
└── Player Quest Boards: 300 TC/hour (inconsistent availability)

Result: Everyone farms NPC quests
  → Auction house has low activity (nobody gathering)
  → Quest boards empty (nobody needs services)
  → Economic stagnation
```

**Scenario B: Balanced - Complementary Systems**
```
Player Decision Matrix:
├── NPC Quest Farming: 400 TC/hour + progression items (bind on pickup)
├── Gathering → Auction House: 350 TC/hour (consistent demand)
├── Crafting → Auction House: 450 TC/hour (requires gathered materials)
└── Player Quest Boards: 
    ├── Gathering Contracts: 400 TC/hour (occasional, high-paying)
    └── Crafting Contracts: 500 TC/hour (uses materials from AH)

Result: Diverse economic activity
  → NPC quests provide baseline currency income
  → Gatherers supply auction house (good steady income)
  → Crafters buy from AH, sell on AH or fulfill quest board orders
  → Quest boards create spikes in demand for specific items
  → Auction house is primary hub for resource flow
  → Quest boards handle specialized, time-sensitive needs
```

### Mechanism 4: Quest Board Design Impact on Auction Houses

**Design A: Direct Competition (BAD)**
```yaml
quest_board_design_competitive:
  gathering_quests:
    example: "Deliver 50 iron ore for 500 TC"
    
    problem: |
      This competes directly with auction house:
      - If AH price for 50 ore = 600 TC, player uses quest board
      - If AH price for 50 ore = 400 TC, player uses auction house
      - Quest boards become "better auction house" with personal service
      - Auction house activity decreases
```

**Design B: Complementary Enhancement (GOOD)**
```yaml
quest_board_design_complementary:
  service_quests:
    example: "Survey northern region and deliver geological report - 1000 TC"
    
    benefit: |
      This enhances auction house activity:
      - Surveyor needs equipment → buys from auction house
      - Survey reveals new resource nodes → supplies auction house
      - Reward currency → spent on auction house
      - Doesn't compete with auction house transactions
  
  crafting_commissions:
    example: "Craft custom tool (I provide materials + 500 TC bonus)"
    
    benefit: |
      - Materials sourced from auction house
      - Crafting services not available on auction house
      - Quest board fills gap that auction house can't
      - Currency circulates through both systems
```

## Case Studies from MMORPGs

### Case Study 1: Final Fantasy XIV - Market Board Dominance

**System Design:**
- **Market Board** (auction house): Very active, robust player economy
- **Quest Rewards**: Primarily currency and bind-on-pickup gear
- **No player quest boards**: Limited player-to-player quest creation

**Economic Result:**
- Market board is thriving center of economy
- Gathering and crafting professions highly valued
- Quest rewards provide purchasing power, not market goods
- Players specialize and trade extensively

**Lesson for BlueMarble:**
Limiting tradeable items in quest rewards protects auction house centrality.

### Case Study 2: EVE Online - Contract System Excellence

**System Design:**
- **Market** (auction house): Extremely active for bulk goods
- **Contracts** (quest boards): Used for specific services, transportation, courier missions
- **Clear Differentiation**: Contracts for services, Market for goods

**Economic Result:**
- Market handles standardized goods (ore, modules, ships)
- Contracts handle unique services (hauling, collateral-based trades, courier)
- Both systems thrive because they serve different needs
- Contracts often require market purchases to fulfill

**Lesson for BlueMarble:**
Quest boards should focus on **services and specialized tasks**, while auction houses handle **standardized goods**.

### Case Study 3: World of Warcraft - Quest Inflation Issues

**System Design:**
- **Auction House**: Active but gold-inflated over time
- **Daily Quests**: Major gold faucet with high rewards
- **No player quest boards**: Limited player economy interaction

**Economic Problem:**
- Daily quest farming became most profitable activity
- Massive currency inflation over expansions
- Auction house prices skyrocketed
- Gathering professions devalued (quest gold > gathering income)

**Lesson for BlueMarble:**
Quest currency rewards must be carefully balanced against gathering/crafting income to prevent economic dominance.

### Case Study 4: Star Wars Galaxies - Crafting Economy Success

**System Design:**
- **Bazaar** (auction house): Primary economy driver
- **Quests**: Minimal currency rewards, mostly for storyline
- **Player Dependencies**: Quests required crafted items from other players

**Economic Result:**
- Thriving player-driven economy
- High auction house activity
- Crafters and gatherers had strong economic role
- Players interacted through trading, not quest farming

**Lesson for BlueMarble:**
Making quests **require** player-crafted or gathered items creates auction house dependency.

## Balancing Mechanisms for BlueMarble

### Mechanism 1: Quest Reward Composition

**Recommended Reward Structure:**

```python

                quest_post.note = "Materials available on Auction House"
        
        return quest_post
```

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Economic Balancing

**Adaptive System:**

```python
class EconomicBalanceMonitor:
    """Monitor and adjust quest/auction house balance dynamically"""
    
    def analyze_economic_health(self):
        """Track key metrics"""
        
        metrics = {
            'auction_house_activity': self.measure_ah_transactions_per_day(),

        # Detect unhealthy patterns
        if metrics['auction_house_activity'] < threshold_low:
            self.trigger_auction_house_stimulus()
        
        if metrics['quest_board_activity'] > metrics['auction_house_activity']:

        return metrics
    
    def trigger_auction_house_stimulus(self):

        actions = [
            'reduce_auction_house_fees_temporarily',
            'increase_npc_quest_requirements_for_crafted_items',
            'add_limited_time_cosmetics_only_via_auction_house',

            'showcase_auction_house_success_stories'
        ]
        self.apply_rebalance(actions)
```

### Mechanism 3: Quest Types and Economic Roles

**Strategic Quest Design:**

```yaml
quest_type_economic_roles:
  
  # Discovery Quests (Enhance AH)
  discovery_missions:
    rewards:
      - currency: 1000-3000 TC
      - knowledge: new_resource_locations
      - progression: survey_tool_upgrades
    
    auction_house_impact: POSITIVE
    reason: |
      - Discovers new resource nodes
      - Players gather discovered resources
      - Resources sold on auction house
      - Currency reward spent on auction house
  
  # Crafting Quests (Drive AH Demand)
  crafting_missions:
    requirements:
      - must_craft_specific_item
      - materials_not_provided
    
    rewards:
      - currency: 800-2000 TC
      - progression: crafting_recipe_unlock
    
    auction_house_impact: POSITIVE
    reason: |
      - Players buy materials from auction house
      - Learn new recipes to sell products on auction house
      - Currency reward circulates back to auction house
  
  # Tutorial Quests (AH Introduction)
  tutorial_missions:
    requirements:
      - "Post your first auction house listing"
      - "Purchase an item from the auction house"
      - "Compare prices across regional auction houses"
    
    rewards:
      - currency: 500 TC
      - knowledge: trading_basics
    
    auction_house_impact: POSITIVE
    reason: |
      - Teaches players to use auction house
      - Creates familiarity and comfort with trading
      - Reduces quest board as "easy alternative"
  
  # Player Quest Board (Complementary)
  player_quest_boards:
    encouraged_quest_types:
      - exploration_services: "Survey this specific region for me"
      - escort_missions: "Protect me while I gather in dangerous area"
      - transport_services: "Haul equipment to remote location"
      - specialized_crafting: "Create custom tool with special properties"
    
    discouraged_quest_types:
      - simple_resource_delivery: "Bring me 50 iron ore" (use AH instead)
      - standard_crafting: "Make me a basic pickaxe" (buy on AH instead)
    
    system_guidance:
      message: |
        For standard items, check the Auction House first!
        Quest boards are best for specialized services and unique requests.
```

### Mechanism 4: Regional Economic Specialization

**Design Strategy:**

```yaml
regional_auction_house_quest_board_balance:
  
  frontier_regions:
    auction_house:
      - limited_supply (few players)
      - high_prices (scarcity)
      - slow_turnover
    
    quest_board:
      - very_active (players need specific items)
      - high_rewards (desperate buyers)
      - service_focused (escort, protection, transport)
    
    design_approach: |
      Quest boards thrive here because auction house can't meet needs.
      This is intentional - frontier = quest board dominance is OK.
  
  established_cities:
    auction_house:
      - abundant_supply (many players)
      - competitive_prices (market efficiency)
      - rapid_turnover
    
    quest_board:
      - moderate_activity (specialized needs only)
      - standard_rewards (market competitive)
      - unique_services (things AH can't provide)
    
    design_approach: |
      Auction house dominates here - this is correct and healthy.
      Quest boards handle edge cases and specialized services.
  
  crafting_hubs:
    auction_house:
      - high_volume_materials (crafters buying)
      - high_volume_finished_goods (crafters selling)
      - price_competition
    
    quest_board:
      - custom_crafting_orders (specific modifications)
      - bulk_orders (large quantities with deadline)
      - quality_focused (master crafters only)
    
    design_approach: |
      Both systems active and complementary.
      AH for standard goods, quest boards for premium/custom work.
```

## Implementation Recommendations for BlueMarble

### Priority 1: Quest Reward Guidelines (Immediate)

**Design Rules:**

1. **NPC Quest Currency Rewards**
   - Base rate: 300-500 TC/hour of gameplay
   - Should match or slightly exceed gathering income (350-450 TC/hour)
   - Prevents quest farming from dominating economy

2. **No Tradeable Resources as Quest Rewards**
   - Exception: Tutorial quests (very small quantities)
   - Exception: One-time achievements (special rewards)
   - General rule: Resources come from gathering → auction house

3. **Bind-on-Pickup Equipment**
   - Quest equipment rewards should be bind-on-pickup
   - Prevents quest farming for gear to sell on auction house
   - Maintains crafted equipment value on auction house

4. **Knowledge and Recipe Unlocks**
   - Quest rewards can include crafting recipes
   - This increases auction house activity (new products to trade)
   - Players sell newly-unlocked crafted items on auction house

**Implementation:**

```python
# quest_reward_validator.py

class QuestRewardValidator:
    """Validates quest rewards maintain economic balance"""
    
    RULES = {
        'max_tradeable_resources_per_quest': 0,  # Zero except special cases
        'equipment_must_be_bind_on_pickup': True,
        'currency_reward_range_per_hour': (300, 500),  # TC
        'allow_recipe_unlocks': True,
        'allow_progression_unlocks': True
    }
    
    def validate_quest_reward(self, quest, reward):
        """Ensure reward doesn't undermine auction house"""
        
        violations = []
        
        # Check for tradeable resources
        for item in reward.items:
            if item.tradeable and item.type == 'resource':
                violations.append(
                    f"Tradeable resource '{item.name}' as reward. "
                    f"Use currency instead. Players should get resources "
                    f"from gathering or auction house."
                )
        
        # Check equipment is bind-on-pickup
        for item in reward.items:
            if item.type == 'equipment' and not item.bind_on_pickup:
                violations.append(
                    f"Equipment '{item.name}' must be bind-on-pickup. "
                    f"Tradeable equipment competes with crafters on auction house."
                )
        
        # Check currency reward rate
        estimated_time = quest.estimated_completion_time_hours
        currency_per_hour = reward.currency / estimated_time
        min_rate, max_rate = self.RULES['currency_reward_range_per_hour']
        
        if currency_per_hour < min_rate:
            violations.append(
                f"Currency reward too low ({currency_per_hour} TC/hour). "
                f"Should be {min_rate}-{max_rate} TC/hour to remain competitive."
            )
        elif currency_per_hour > max_rate:
            violations.append(
                f"Currency reward too high ({currency_per_hour} TC/hour). "
                f"Would make quest farming more profitable than trading, "
                f"harming auction house activity."
            )

### Priority 4: Tutorial and Player Education

**Teaching Complementary Systems:**

```yaml
tutorial_quest_chain:
  
  quest_1_auction_house_basics:

## Potential Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Quest Board Becomes "Better Auction House"

**Problem:**
Players discover they can get better prices/faster delivery through quest boards than auction house.

**Example:**
```
Auction House: Iron Ore = 5 TC per unit, must search/bid
Quest Board: "Deliver 100 iron ore for 600 TC" (6 TC per unit + convenience)

Result: Buyers prefer quest boards → Auction house dies
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
prevention_mechanisms:
  
  system_fee_structure:
    auction_house_fee: 4%
    quest_board_fee: 8-10%  # Higher fee discourages simple trading
  
  guidance_system:
    when_posting_resource_quest:
      message: |
        "Iron Ore is available on the Auction House!
        Current price: 5 TC per unit, 450 units available
        Using quest board for this: 10% fee = 60 TC
        Using auction house directly: 4% fee = 24 TC
        Recommendation: Purchase directly from Auction House"
  
  quest_board_focus:
    encourage: "Services not available on auction house"
    discourage: "Simple resource purchases"
```

### Pitfall 2: NPC Quest Rewards Flood Auction House

**Problem:**
Quest rewards include tradeable resources that flood the market.

**Example:**
```
Daily Quest: "Survey northern region" 
Rewards: 500 TC + 50 iron ore (tradeable)

Result: Everyone farms quest, gets free ore, sells on AH
  → Iron ore prices crash
  → Gatherers can't compete
  → Gathering profession dies
  → Auction house supply dries up (no one gathering)
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
strict_reward_policy:
  
  npc_quest_rewards:
    allowed:
      - currency
      - bind_on_pickup_equipment
      - recipe_unlocks
      - progression_items
      - reputation
    
    forbidden:
      - tradeable_resources
      - tradeable_equipment
      - tradeable_consumables
  
  exception_handling:
    tutorial_quests:
      - may_include_small_tradeable_amounts
      - purpose: introduce_player_to_systems
      - quantity: minimal (1-5 units max)
    
    one_time_achievements:
      - may_include_special_rewards
      - must_be_rare_and_valuable
      - cannot_be_farmed_repeatedly
```

### Pitfall 3: Quest Currency Inflation

**Problem:**
Too much currency from quests, not enough currency sinks.

**Example:**
```
Quest Rewards: 3000 TC per player per day
Currency Sinks: 1500 TC per player per day

Result: 
  → Net inflation: 1500 TC per player per day
  → After 30 days: 45,000 TC excess per player
  → Auction house prices inflate
  → Quest rewards worth less
  → Economic instability
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
balanced_currency_flow:
  
  faucets:
    npc_quests: 2000-3000 TC per player per day
    monster_loot: 500-1000 TC per player per day
    resource_sales_to_npcs: 500-1000 TC per player per day
    total_faucet: 3000-5000 TC per player per day
  
  sinks:
    equipment_repair: 500-800 TC per player per day
    fast_travel: 200-400 TC per player per day
    consumables: 300-500 TC per player per day
    auction_house_fees: 300-600 TC per player per day
    quest_board_fees: 100-200 TC per player per day
    skill_training: 200-400 TC per player per day
    structure_upkeep: 200-300 TC per player per day
    total_sink: 2800-4200 TC per player per day
  
  target_balance:
    slight_inflation: 200-800 TC per player per day
    reason: "Gentle inflation rewards active players, acceptable level"
  
  monitoring:
    if_net_inflation_exceeds: 1000 TC per player per day
    action: "Reduce quest rewards or increase sink costs by 10%"
```

### Pitfall 4: Regional Imbalances

**Problem:**
Quest boards thrive in some regions, auction houses in others, creating economic fragmentation.

**Example:**
```
Frontier Region:
  - Quest board: Very active (few players, high service demand)
  - Auction house: Dead (no supply, no traders)
  - Problem: Players can't get resources, isolated economy

City Region:
  - Quest board: Empty (no demand, auction house better)
  - Auction house: Hyperactive (all trading here)
  - Problem: No service economy, just commodity trading
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
regional_economic_design:
  
  frontier_regions:
    design_philosophy: "Quest boards primary, AH supplementary"
    
    quest_board_bonuses:
      - reduced_fees: 5% instead of 8%
      - highlighted_visibility
      - npc_starter_quests: "Post your first quest here!"
    
    auction_house_support:
      - connected_to_city_markets: true
      - remote_listing_fee: 6% instead of 4%
      - still_accessible: true
    
    rationale: |
      Frontier = small population = quest boards make sense
      Allow AH access for bulk goods
      Quest boards for specialized local services
  
  city_regions:
    design_philosophy: "Auction house primary, quest boards for specialists"
    
    auction_house_advantages:
      - standard_fees: 4%
      - high_traffic: maximum_visibility
      - fast_turnover: competitive_prices
    
    quest_board_focus:
      - premium_services_only
      - master_crafter_commissions
      - specialized_exploration_contracts
      - higher_quality_standard
    
    rationale: |
      Cities = large population = AH efficiency wins
      Quest boards for premium/specialized services
      Mass market goods go through AH
  
  trade_routes:
    connect_regional_auction_houses: true
    price_arbitrage_opportunities: true
    transport_quests_on_quest_boards: encouraged
    
    synergy: |
      "Check city AH prices, buy low in frontier, 
      post transport quest on QB, sell high in city"
```

## Conclusion

**Research Question**: How does quest creation affect the balance between in-game auction houses vs. quest boards?

**Answer**: 

Quest creation is a **critical economic lever** that can either support or undermine auction house health:

1. **Quest Rewards as Faucets**: NPC quests inject currency (good for AH) but must never inject tradeable resources (bad for AH)

2. **Opportunity Cost**: If quest farming is more profitable than gathering/crafting → players abandon AH participation

3. **Quest Boards as Alternative**: If player-created quests handle resource trading → they compete with and can replace auction houses

4. **Complementary Design**: When quests provide currency and progression while quest boards focus on services → both systems thrive

**BlueMarble Recommendation:**

Design quest systems and quest boards as **complementary economic tools** rather than competing alternatives:

- **Auction Houses** → Primary hub for resource/item trading (bulk, standardized goods)
- **Quest Boards** → Secondary system for specialized services (unique, time-sensitive, personal)
- **NPC Quests** → Currency faucets that drive purchasing power for both systems

**Critical Success Factors:**

✅ Quest rewards = Currency + Bind-on-Pickup items  
✅ Quest board fees higher than auction house fees  
✅ Strong player education: "AH for items, QB for services"  
✅ Active monitoring and dynamic balancing  
✅ Regional variation (frontier = QB emphasis, cities = AH emphasis)

When properly balanced, quest creation enhances auction house activity by creating purchasing power and demand for crafted/gathered goods, while quest boards fill market gaps that auction houses cannot serve.

## Further Research Questions

1. **Optimal Quest Reward Currency Amounts**
   - What TC/hour rate keeps questing competitive without dominating?
   - How should rewards scale with player level?

2. **Quest Board Fee Structures**
   - What fee percentage discourages resource trading but allows service economy?
   - Should fees vary by quest type?

3. **Regional Economic Balance**
   - How many players before quest boards become inefficient vs auction houses?
   - What's the optimal AH/QB balance for different region types?

4. **Seasonal and Event Dynamics**
   - How do special events affect AH vs QB balance?
   - Should seasonal quests have different reward structures?

5. **Player Behavior Patterns**
   - What percentage of players prefer questing vs trading?
   - How do playstyle preferences affect economic participation?
