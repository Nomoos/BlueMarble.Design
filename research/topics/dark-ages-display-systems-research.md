# Dark Ages Display Systems Research

## Problem / Context

BlueMarble requires research into UI/display systems for a medieval "dark ages" aesthetic similar to games like Graveyard Keeper and other pixel art management simulation games. This research informs the design of immersive, period-appropriate interfaces for inventory, crafting, dialogue, HUD elements, and other game systems.

Key questions:
- What visual and interaction patterns define successful dark ages/medieval game UIs?
- How do games like Graveyard Keeper balance historical authenticity with modern usability?
- What are the common design elements across pixel art medieval management games?
- How can these patterns be adapted for BlueMarble's geological MMORPG setting?

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Graveyard Keeper's UI Design Approach

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Top-down 2D pixel art** with retro simulation game inspiration
- **Medieval dark ages aesthetic** achieved through themed UI components
- **Functional management gameplay** balanced with immersive theming

**Specific UI Elements:**
- Grid-based inventory with pixel art medieval items (body parts, herbs, tools, crops)
- Contextual crafting menus for workbenches, ovens, autopsy tables, alchemy labs
- Parchment-like technology/skill tree resembling medieval manuscripts
- Stylized map with rustic medieval location icons (church, tavern, blacksmith)
- Color-coded dialogue boxes with medieval character portraits
- Pixel art HUD motifs (candles, skulls, coins) in scroll-like or wooden panels
- Quest log styled as old book with faded ink and ragged paper edges
- Dungeon UI with torches, magical runes, and medieval dungeon-crawl tropes

**Design Philosophy:**
- Supports deep management gameplay while reinforcing "inaccurate medieval cemetery sim" comedy
- Dark ages inspired display using visual references to classic medieval imagery
- Functional overlays for grave management, autopsies, farming, brewing, sermons, shops

### Finding 2: Common Design Patterns in Medieval Games

**Panel-Based Layouts:**
- Modular, framed windows for inventory and crafting
- Panels mimic wood, stone, or parchment textures
- Ornate metalwork or leather strap borders
- Tab systems using banners, shields, or painted wood slats

**Visual Textures:**
- Wood grain, aged parchment, cracked stone, wrought iron, gold leaf
- Tactile, hand-crafted feeling for window backgrounds and borders
- Weathered and aged materials to convey historical authenticity

**Typography:**
- Gothic, blackletter, or runic fonts for headers
- Stylized serif fonts for body text clarity
- Simulated ink or calligraphy for authenticity
- Balance between thematic style and readability

**Color Schemes:**
- Earthy tones: deep browns, greens, faded reds
