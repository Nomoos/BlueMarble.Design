## Core Setting: The Tower-City of Spire

### The Physical Structure

**Spire: The City Itself**
- A mile-high tower rising from the ground, ancient and mysterious
- Built in vertical districts, each with distinct character and purpose
- Architecture mixes gothic, dark fantasy, and weird elements
- The deeper/lower districts are older, darker, stranger
- The higher districts are controlled by the aelfir elite
- Impossible geometry in older sections suggests eldritch construction

**Geographic Layers:**
- **The Spire**: The massive central tower containing the city
- **The City**: The surface-level metropolis at the tower's base
- **The Heart**: The mysterious, dangerous depths beneath the Spire (setting for the companion game "Heart: The City Beneath")
- **The Vermissian**: An abandoned subway system, now twisted and dangerous

### The Social Order

**The Aelfir (High Elves)**
- The ruling class of Spire, conquered the drow centuries ago
- Immortal or extremely long-lived, decadent, cruel
- Control government, military, economy, and culture
- View drow as servants, tools, or curiosities
- Maintain power through institutional control and overwhelming force
- Culturally refined but morally bankrupt
- Obsessed with status, beauty, and eternal youth

**The Drow (Dark Elves)**
- The oppressed majority, living under aelfir rule
- Pushed into lower districts, menial work, and poverty
- Rich cultural traditions suppressed by occupation
- Varying responses to oppression: collaboration, resignation, or resistance
- Complex skin-tone based caste system within drow society
- Deep religious traditions focused on forbidden gods

**Other Inhabitants:**
- Humans, gnomes, and other species live in Spire
- Generally occupy middle positions in the social hierarchy
- Some profit from the occupation, others sympathize with drow
- The city is cosmopolitan but deeply stratified

---

## Key Factions and Power Dynamics

### The Ministry (Aelfir Government)

**Structure:**
- Bureaucratic control apparatus
- Multiple departments managing different aspects of city life
- The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress (secret police)
- Department of Development (urban planning, displacement)
- Ministry of Records (propaganda, information control)

**Methods:**
- Institutional violence and control
- Surveillance and informants
- Economic exploitation
- Cultural suppression
- Strategic neglect of drow districts

### The Resistance (Player Characters)

**Organization:**
- Cell-based structure for operational security
- Each cell operates semi-independently
- Shared ideological commitment to liberation
- Mix of idealists, pragmatists, extremists, and those with nothing to lose
- Internal tensions about methods and goals

**Goals:**
- Overthrow aelfir rule
- Restore drow sovereignty and culture
- Varying visions of what comes after revolution
- Some seek reform, others total destruction

**Methods:**
- Sabotage and terrorism
- Propaganda and consciousness-raising
- Assassination of collaborators and oppressors
- Theft and redistribution of resources
- Building parallel power structures

**Moral Complexity:**
- Resistance actions often harm innocents
- Revolutionary violence justified by oppression but still violent
- Collaborators may be drow just trying to survive
- Victory may be impossible, but resistance gives meaning

### Other Factions

**The Midwives (Religious Order)**
- Priestesses of the drow goddess Our Hidden Mistress
- Maintain underground religious practices
- Provide social services to drow communities
- Some overlap with Resistance
- Walk a dangerous line between legality and rebellion

**Criminal Organizations**
- Various gangs and crime families
- Some drow-led, some multi-ethnic
- May ally with or oppose Resistance
- Primarily interested in profit, not liberation

**The Bound (Drow Establishment)**
- Drow who have prospered under aelfir rule
- Merchants, administrators, enforcers
- Seen as traitors by the Resistance
- Often targets for assassination
- Complex motivations: survival, ambition, genuine loyalty, or secret resistance

**The Knights of North Docks**
- A drow military order serving the aelfir
- Elite soldiers, deeply indoctrinated
- Viewed as ultimate traitors by most drow
- Sometimes conflicted about their role

---

## Central Themes

### 1. Rebellion and Revolution

**The Doomed Struggle:**
- Players cannot truly "win" against aelfir power
- Revolution is about the struggle itself, not victory
- Small symbolic victories matter more than strategic ones
- How you fight defines who you are
- The question is not "if" you'll die, but "how" you'll die

**Asymmetric Warfare:**
- Resistance cannot fight the aelfir openly
- Every action has risks and costs
- Players must choose targets carefully
- Retreat and survival are valid victories
- Power imbalance forces creative solutions

### 2. Corruption (Physical and Moral)

**The Rot Within:**
- The city itself is corrupted, infected with strange forces
- Revolutionary actions corrupt those who take them
- Violence necessary for liberation degrades the revolutionary
- Compromise with evil to fight evil
- Becoming the monster to fight monsters

**Physical Manifestations:**
- Strange growths, infections, transformations
- Contact with Heart or Vermissian warps the body
- Magic and power come with physical costs
- The city's architecture reflects moral decay

### 3. Faith and the Divine

**Hidden Gods:**
- Drow worship gods forbidden by aelfir law
- Our Hidden Mistress: goddess of secrets, blood, revolution
- The Amaranthine Church: aelfir state religion
- True faith versus state-mandated religion
- Prayer as resistance, worship as rebellion

**Divine Ambiguity:**
- Gods may or may not exist
- Faith provides meaning regardless of divine reality
- Religious structures provide community and purpose
- Fanaticism versus pragmatic belief

### 4. Secrecy and Information

**Living in Shadows:**
- Resistance operates through secrecy
- Knowledge is power and danger
- Who knows what, and who knows they know?
- Trust is rare and precious
- Betrayal is always possible

**The Cost of Secrets:**
- Lying to loved ones to protect them
- Isolation from normal life
- Paranoia as survival mechanism
- Identity fragmentation (resistance self vs. public self)

### 5. Identity and Culture

**Cultural Survival:**
- Drow culture suppressed but not destroyed
- Language, religion, art preserved in secret
- Cultural resistance as important as violent resistance
- Generational trauma and memory

**Assimilation Pressure:**
- Drow encouraged to adopt aelfir culture
- Success requires rejecting drow identity
- Code-switching as survival
- Loss of language and tradition

### 6. Class and Solidarity

**Internal Divisions:**
- Not all drow support revolution
- Class divisions within drow society
- Skin tone caste system creates hierarchy
- Wealthy drow may oppose poor drow interests

**Coalition Building:**
- Building solidarity across differences
- Non-drow allies and sympathizers
- Working class unity across species
- Competing visions of liberation

## The Resistance System: Mechanics Reinforcing Narrative

### Stress and Fallout Mechanics

**No Hit Points:**
- Characters don't have traditional health
- Instead, five stress tracks: Blood, Mind, Silver, Shadow, Reputation
- Actions and consequences fill stress tracks
- When a track fills completely, roll for Fallout

**Stress Tracks:**

1. **Blood Stress** (Physical Harm)
   - Violence, injury, exhaustion
   - Represents physical toll of resistance
   - Fallout: Injury, disfigurement, death

2. **Mind Stress** (Psychological Damage)
   - Trauma, horror, cognitive dissonance
   - The mental cost of violence and loss
   - Fallout: Madness, phobias, psychological breaks

3. **Silver Stress** (Economic Pressure)
   - Debt, poverty, financial ruin
   - Cost of funding resistance activities
   - Fallout: Bankruptcy, owing dangerous people, desperation

4. **Shadow Stress** (Occult Corruption)
   - Exposure to weird magic and dark forces
   - The supernatural cost of power
   - Fallout: Mutations, curses, possession

5. **Reputation Stress** (Social Standing)
   - Being exposed, discredited, or disgraced
   - The social cost of resistance
   - Fallout: Exile, enemies, burned bridges

**Fallout System:**
- When stress fills a track, roll for consequences
- Minor fallout: Temporary problems (broken bone, debt, paranoia)
- Major fallout: Permanent changes (missing limb, insanity, corruption)
- Severe fallout: Character death or removal from play
- Fallout creates story complications, not just mechanical penalties

**Design Philosophy:**
- Failure creates interesting complications, not dead ends
- Character degradation is inevitable, not preventable
- The question is not "will you be harmed?" but "how will you be harmed?"
- Consequences drive narrative forward
- Players choose which stress to take, creating meaningful decisions

### Skills and Domains

**Domain System:**
- Skills organized into ten thematic domains
- Each domain represents a sphere of influence or activity
- Characters excel in some domains, weak in others
- Domains: Academia, Crime, High Society, Low Society, Occult, Order, Religion, Technology, Commerce, Wilderness

**Dice Pool Mechanics:**
- Roll d10s based on skill level (0-3 dice)
- Success on 7+, each success is a degree of success
- More successes = better outcome, but also more stress
- Players choose whether to push for more successes (risking more stress)
- Difficult actions require more successes
- GM assigns difficulty and stress cost

**Resistance Rolls:**
- When facing danger, roll to resist consequences
- Roll domain dice to reduce stress
- Success reduces stress taken, but rarely eliminates it
- Reinforces that actions have costs even when successful

### Character Classes (Deeply Integrated with Lore)

**Design Principle:**
- Classes are not generic fantasy archetypes
- Each class tells a story about the setting
- Mechanical abilities reflect cultural position
- Playing a class teaches you about Spire's world

**Example Classes:**

1. **Bound (Collaborator Turned Traitor)**
   - Former drow establishment figure now in resistance
   - Access to high society and resources
   - Burdened by guilt and past complicity
   - Mechanics reflect using privilege for revolution

2. **Carrion-Priest (Death Cult Leader)**
   - Priest of drow death god
   - Resurrects dead for resistance
   - Deals with corpses and decay
   - Mechanics involve necromancy and funeral rites

3. **Firebrand (Agitator and Propagandist)**
   - Inspire crowds, spread revolutionary fervor
   - Public face of resistance
   - High social stress, risk of exposure
   - Mechanics focus on rhetoric and manipulation

4. **Midwife (Religious Authority)**
   - Priestess of Our Hidden Mistress
   - Community support and secret networks
   - Religious authority among drow
   - Mechanics involve blessings, healing, social support

5. **Vermissian Sage (Subway Wizard)**
   - Magician specializing in the abandoned subway
   - Studies impossible spaces and eldritch forces
   - Mentally unstable from exposure to weird
   - Mechanics involve reality-bending and occult knowledge

6. **Azurite (Magical Drug Smuggler)**
   - Deals in reality-altering substances
   - Connections to criminal underworld
   - Walking pharmacy of weird effects
   - Mechanics involve drugs, poisons, and altered states

7. **Knight (Traitor to the Order)**
   - Former North Docks Knight turned revolutionary
   - Elite combat training and military knowledge
   - Hunted by former comrades
   - Mechanics focus on military tactics and violence

8. **Lajhan (Arena Fighter)**
   - Gladiator from the fighting pits
   - Violence as performance and survival
   - Celebrity status with drow underclass
   - Mechanics emphasize dramatic combat

**Class Mechanical Identity:**
- Each class has unique stress relief abilities
- Signature equipment and resources
- Specific fallout tables
- Advancement tracks tied to class narrative

### Adventures and Missions

**Mission Structure:**
- Resistance cells given objectives by higher-ups
- Players choose approach and methods
- No "correct" solution, multiple valid approaches
- GM presents situations, not railroads

**Typical Mission Types:**
- Assassination (remove aelfir official or collaborator)
- Sabotage (destroy infrastructure or supplies)
- Propaganda (spread message, inspire others)
- Theft (acquire resources or information)
- Protection (guard important person or place)
- Investigation (uncover secrets or plots)

**Failure Forward:**
- Failed missions create complications, not endings
- Every action moves story forward
- Heat system tracks Ministry attention
- Consequences cascade into future missions
- Players dealing with previous mistakes is content

### The Tension Mechanics

**Resource Management:**
- Limited money (Silver stress represents poverty)
- Limited time (Ministry closing in)
- Limited trust (who's an informant?)
- Limited safety (nowhere truly safe)

**Escalating Heat:**
- Ministry tracks resistance activities
- More activity = more attention = more danger
- Players must balance action with caution
- Sometimes lying low is necessary
- Occasionally must relocate or go dark

**Meaningful Choices:**
- Help community or maintain cover?
- Risk exposure for greater impact?
- Use violence or more subtle approach?
- Protect self or protect others?
- Compromise or hold to principles?

## Implications for BlueMarble Design

### Applicable Lessons

**1. Mechanical Consequences Create Story**
- Spire's stress/fallout system generates narrative from gameplay
- BlueMarble could use wear/degradation mechanics for long-term characters
- Resource pressure (Silver stress) creates economic storytelling
- Multiple consequence types prevent one-dimensional risk

**2. Failure Forward Design**
- Failed actions in Spire create complications, not dead ends
- Mining accident could lead to discovery in BlueMarble
- Economic failure creates new opportunities
- Keeps players engaged even when things go wrong

**3. Asymmetric Power Dynamics**
- Resistance vs. Ministry creates David vs. Goliath tension
- BlueMarble factions could have vastly different power levels
- Alternative victory conditions (escape, delay, message)
- Not every conflict is winnable through direct confrontation

**4. Class Design as World-Building**
- Spire classes teach setting through mechanics
- BlueMarble professions could reflect regional culture
- Mechanical identity reinforces narrative identity
- Players learn world by playing character

**5. Moral Complexity and Cost**
- Revolutionary violence is necessary but corrupting
- BlueMarble could explore ethical dimensions of economy
- Exploitation, environmental damage, labor relations
- Player choices have moral weight, not just strategic

**6. Community and Culture as Resistance**
- Preserving drow culture is resistance act
- BlueMarble could feature cultural preservation mechanics
- Player-created traditions and practices
- Economic solidarity as gameplay element

**7. Stress-Based Pacing**
- Multiple stress tracks create varied pressure
- BlueMarble could use multiple resource types
- Forces players to choose what to risk
- Different activities threaten different resources

### Design Patterns to Adapt

**Long-Term Character Wear:**
```javascript
class CharacterWearSystem {
    // Adapt Spire's fallout for BlueMarble longevity
    accumulateWear(activity) {
        // Mining, crafting, travel accumulate wear
        // Eventually triggers retirement or permanent changes
    }
}
```

**Faction-Specific Professions:**
- Each settlement could have unique profession
- Volcanic Forger (volcanic region)
- Deep Miner (mountain settlements)
- Vermissian Sage → Subway Salvager (urban regions)

**Underdog Conflict Mechanics:**
- When fighting superior forces, alternative win conditions
- Survival, escape, delay as valid victories
- Encourages creativity and roleplay over combat focus

**Failure Creates Content:**
- Failed trade creates debt story
- Mining accident reveals new resource
- Diplomatic failure creates rivalry
- System generates story from setbacks
