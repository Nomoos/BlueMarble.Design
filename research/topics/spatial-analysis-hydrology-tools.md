# Spatial Analysis: Hydrology Tools

## Problem / Context

BlueMarble requires sophisticated terrain and water flow simulation for realistic world generation and gameplay mechanics. Understanding professional GIS hydrology tools helps inform our approach to water flow, drainage basins, and terrain analysis at a planetary scale.

This research examines ArcGIS Spatial Analyst hydrology tools to extract key concepts for implementation in BlueMarble's geological simulation MMORPG.

## Key Findings

- **Flow Direction**: Determines the direction of water flow from each cell in a raster surface based on steepest descent
  - Critical for simulating realistic water drainage patterns
  - Foundation for watershed and basin delineation
  - Supports multiple algorithms: D8, D-Infinity, Multiple Flow Direction (MFD)

- **Basin Analysis**: Delineates all drainage basins (watersheds) from a flow direction raster
  - Identifies natural boundaries for resource distribution
  - Useful for regional planning and territory design
  - Can be nested hierarchically (sub-basins within major basins)

- **Flow Accumulation**: Calculates accumulated flow into each cell
  - Identifies natural stream/river locations
  - Determines water volume concentration areas
  - Essential for flood simulation and water resource management

- **Sink Identification**: Locates depressions where flow cannot continue
  - Natural lakes and endorheic basins (landlocked drainage)
  - Critical for realistic terrain that includes inland seas
  - Requires special handling in flow algorithms

## Evidence

### Source 1: Flow Direction Tool

- **Link**: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.4/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/flow-direction.htm
- **Key Points**:
  - D8 method: Flow from each cell to one of eight neighbors (steepest descent)
  - Output codes represent direction (1=E, 2=SE, 4=S, 8=SW, 16=W, 32=NW, 64=N, 128=NE)
  - Handles flat areas using specialized algorithms
  - Edge cells can flow outward or be treated as no-data
- **Relevance**: Foundation for all water flow simulation in terrain systems

### Source 2: Basin Tool

- **Link**: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.4/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/basin.htm
- **Key Points**:
  - Requires flow direction raster as input
  - Creates unique basin identifier for each drainage area
  - All cells in a basin share the same pour point (outlet)
  - Can identify disconnected basins (endorheic drainage)
- **Relevance**: Natural geographic boundaries for game territories, resource zones

### Source 3: Hydrology Toolset Overview

- **Link**: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.4/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/an-overview-of-the-hydrology-tools.htm
- **Key Points**:
  - Complete workflow: Fill sinks → Flow direction → Flow accumulation → Stream definition → Basin delineation
  - Supports both raster and vector inputs
  - Tools include: Fill, Flow Direction, Flow Accumulation, Basin, Watershed, Stream Order, Stream Link
  - Can handle large DEMs (Digital Elevation Models)
- **Relevance**: Provides complete methodology for terrain water analysis

### Data/Observations

- Industry-standard approach uses raster (grid) representation for efficiency
- Flow algorithms must handle edge cases: flats, pits, edges
- Hierarchical stream networks emerge naturally from flow accumulation
- Processing order matters: must fill sinks before computing flow direction

## Implications for Design

- **Terrain Generation**: BlueMarble should implement flow direction analysis during world generation
  - Pre-compute drainage basins for each region
  - Store basin IDs with terrain data for runtime queries
  - Impact: Enables realistic water distribution and natural boundaries

- **Water Resource Gameplay**: Basin delineation creates natural resource zones
  - Water availability determined by basin characteristics
  - Upstream/downstream relationships affect settlements
  - Impact: Realistic constraints for city placement and resource competition

- **Performance Optimization**: Pre-compute hydrology during world generation, not runtime
  - Flow direction can be cached as 3-bit values per terrain cell
  - Basin IDs provide O(1) lookup for drainage area queries
  - Impact: Minimal runtime cost for water-related queries

- **Procedural Rivers**: Use flow accumulation threshold to generate river networks
  - Cells with high accumulation become streams/rivers
  - Width proportional to accumulated flow
  - Impact: Automatic, realistic river placement without manual design

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### Open Questions

- How do we adapt 2D flow algorithms to 3D spherical terrain?
- What flow accumulation threshold should trigger river generation?
- How do we handle underground water flow vs surface flow?
- Should we support dynamic terrain deformation affecting drainage?

### Next Steps

- [ ] Research D8 vs D-Infinity vs MFD algorithms for accuracy vs performance
- [ ] Design data structure for storing flow direction on spherical grid
- [ ] Implement basin delineation prototype for test terrain
- [ ] Define water accumulation thresholds for different biomes
- [ ] Plan integration with existing terrain generation pipeline
