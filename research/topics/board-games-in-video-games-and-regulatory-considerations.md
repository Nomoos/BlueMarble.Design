## Problem / Context

How can traditional board games (Chess, Shogi, Go, and similar abstract strategy games) be 
incorporated into video games as mini-games or social activities? What are the regulatory 
implications when these games involve cryptocurrency rewards (ETH/BTC)? This research 
examines game rules, implementation examples, and legal considerations.

- Traditional board games provide engaging social activities in MMORPGs
- In-game mini-games enhance player social interaction and downtime activities
- Cryptocurrency integration raises gambling and regulatory concerns
- Need to understand legal boundaries for reward systems

## Key Findings

- **Chess, Shogi, and Go in Games**: These abstract strategy games are commonly implemented as 
  tavern games, social activities, or strategic mini-games in RPGs and MMORPGs
  - Witcher 3's Gwent became so popular it spawned a standalone game
  - Final Fantasy XIV features Triple Triad, Mahjong, and Lord of Verminion
  - Red Dead Redemption 2 includes Poker, Blackjack, and Dominoes
  - Ancient board games provide authentic historical flavor in period games

- **Kivas/Mancala Games**: Lesser known in video games but excellent for implementation
  - Simple rules with deep strategic gameplay
  - Cultural authenticity for historical/cultural settings
  - Easy to implement with visual feedback
  - Short game sessions (5-15 minutes)

- **Regulatory Considerations**: Cryptocurrency rewards create significant legal complexity
  - Games of skill vs. games of chance have different legal classifications
  - Most jurisdictions regulate gambling involving real money or cryptocurrency
  - "Play-to-earn" models face increasing regulatory scrutiny
  - Implementation must carefully avoid gambling classifications

## Evidence

### Source 1: Board Games in Video Games

- **Examples of Implementation**:
  - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Gwent (collectible card game)
  - Final Fantasy XIV - Triple Triad, Mahjong, Lord of Verminion
  - Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Dice games, Farkle
  - Assassin's Creed Valhalla - Orlog (dice game), Flyting
  - Red Dead Redemption 2 - Poker, Blackjack, Dominoes, Five Finger Fillet
  - Fable 2 & 3 - Pub Games
  - The Elder Scrolls Online - Tales of Tribute (deck-building card game)

- **Key Implementation Patterns**:
  - Tavern/social hub locations for player interaction
  - In-game currency rewards (not real money)
  - Collectible elements (cards, pieces) as progression system
  - Tournament structures for competitive play
  - Single-player against NPCs and multiplayer against players
  - Achievements and rankings for engagement

- **Relevance**: Demonstrates proven patterns for implementing traditional games within MMORPGs, 
  providing social content and alternate progression paths

### Source 2: Chess Rules and Implementation

- **Basic Rules**:
  - 8x8 board with alternating colored squares
  - 16 pieces per player: King, Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns
  - Each piece type moves differently (Knights in L-shape, Bishops diagonally, etc.)
  - Objective: Checkmate opponent's King
  - Special moves: Castling, En passant, Pawn promotion

- **Video Game Implementations**:
  - Pure Chess (2012) - Photorealistic 3D chess
  - Chessmaster series - Tutorials and AI opponents
  - Chess.com - Online multiplayer with millions of players
  - Auto Chess genre - Chess-inspired tactical battlers (not traditional chess)

- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
  - Clear rule set, well-documented
  - Complex AI requires significant development (minimax, alpha-beta pruning)
  - Can use existing chess engines (Stockfish, open-source)
  - Visual representation straightforward
  - Universal recognition - no tutorial needed for most players

- **Relevance**: Chess is universally recognized and can be implemented with existing open-source 
  engines, reducing development complexity while providing high-quality AI opponents

### Source 3: Shogi Rules and Implementation

- **Basic Rules**:
  - 9x9 board with 20 pieces per player
  - Similar to chess but pieces are not colored (orientation shows ownership)
  - Captured pieces can be "dropped" back on the board for the capturing player
  - Promotion zone: Last three ranks promote pieces
  - More complex than chess due to drop mechanic

- **Cultural Significance**:
  - Traditional Japanese board game with 500+ year history
  - Professional shogi players in Japan similar to professional chess players
  - Featured in Japanese media and culture

- **Video Game Examples**:
  - Yakuza series - Playable shogi mini-game
  - Animal Crossing - Shogi pieces as collectible furniture
  - Pok√©mon Conquest - Inspired by shogi mechanics
  - 81 Dojo - Online shogi platform

- **Implementation Complexity**: High
  - Less familiar to Western audiences (requires tutorial)
  - Drop mechanic adds strategic depth and complexity
  - AI development more complex than chess
  - Piece recognition requires clear visual design

- **Relevance**: Provides authentic Japanese cultural content, excellent for games with 
  Asian settings or themes, but requires more player education than chess

### Source 4: Go (Baduk/Weiqi) Rules and Implementation

- **Basic Rules**:
  - 19x19 grid (also 9x9 and 13x13 for beginners)
  - Players place stones on intersections, not squares
  - Capture enemy stones by surrounding them
  - Territory control - most territory wins
  - Extremely simple rules, extraordinarily deep strategy

- **Complexity Paradox**:
  - Simplest rules of major board games
  - Most complex strategic depth (more possible positions than atoms in universe)
  - AI was unable to beat top humans until AlphaGo in 2016
  - Learning curve is very steep for mastery

- **Video Game Examples**:
  - NetHack - Appears as decorative game boards
  - Kingdom of Loathing - Mini-game implementation
  - Hikaru no Go games - Anime-based go games
  - Online Go Server (OGS) - Web-based platform
  - Few major MMORPG implementations due to complexity

- **Implementation Complexity**: Extreme
  - Simple rules but complex scoring
  - Extremely difficult AI (requires modern machine learning)
  - Long game sessions (30+ minutes to hours)
  - High learning curve for players
  - Visual clarity important for board state

- **Relevance**: While culturally significant in East Asia, Go's complexity and time 
  requirements make it challenging for casual mini-game implementation. Better suited 
  for dedicated Go games or simplified variants.

### Source 5: Mancala/Kivas Rules and Implementation

- **Basic Rules** (Kalah variant):
  - Two rows of 6 pits with stores at each end
  - 4 stones in each pit at start
  - Players pick up all stones from one pit and distribute counter-clockwise
  - Capture opponent's stones under specific conditions
  - Player with most stones in their store wins

- **Game Variants**:
  - Kalah - Most common Western variant
  - Oware - West African variant with different rules
  - Congkak - Southeast Asian variant
  - Bao - Complex East African variant

- **Implementation Examples**:
  - Civilization VI - Mancala appears as city-state mini-game
  - Various mobile games and educational software
  - Rarely implemented in major MMORPGs

- **Implementation Complexity**: Low to Medium
  - Simple visual design (pits and stones)
  - Clear rule set and quick gameplay
  - AI can be implemented with moderate difficulty
  - Short game sessions (5-15 minutes)
  - Great for mobile and casual play

- **Cultural Significance**:
  - One of oldest games in human history (7000+ years)
  - Popular across Africa, Middle East, Asia
  - Provides authentic cultural representation

- **Relevance**: Excellent candidate for mini-game implementation due to simple rules, 
  quick gameplay, and cultural authenticity. Less well-known in Western markets but 
  easy to learn.

### Source 6: Regulatory Considerations - Gambling vs. Gaming

- **Legal Definitions**:
  - **Gambling**: Activity requiring three elements:
    1. Consideration (something of value wagered)
    2. Chance (outcome determined by randomness)
    3. Prize (reward of value)
  - **Games of Skill**: Outcomes determined primarily by player skill, not chance
  - **Games of Chance**: Outcomes determined primarily by randomness

- **Board Games Classification**:
  - Chess, Shogi, Go - Pure skill games (no randomness)
  - Backgammon - Mixed (dice = chance, strategy = skill)
  - Poker - Mixed (cards = chance, betting strategy = skill)
  - Mancala - Pure skill game (no randomness)

- **Key Legal Principle**: Pure skill games generally not classified as gambling, 
  even with entry fees and prizes, in most jurisdictions.

- **Precedents**:
  - Chess tournaments with entry fees and cash prizes are legal worldwide
  - Fantasy sports ruled "skill games" in many US jurisdictions
  - E-sports tournaments with cash prizes generally legal
  - "Skill game" classification varies by jurisdiction

- **Relevance**: Board games based purely on skill (Chess, Shogi, Go, Mancala) have 
  strongest legal standing for prize-based competitions, including cryptocurrency rewards.

### Source 7: Cryptocurrency and Gaming Regulations

- **Current Regulatory Landscape** (as of 2024):
  - **European Union**: MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation requires licensing 
    for crypto services; games with crypto rewards may require licensing
  - **United States**: SEC treats many crypto tokens as securities; state-by-state 
    gambling laws apply; games may require money transmitter licenses
  - **China**: Cryptocurrency trading and gaming banned
  - **Japan**: Crypto exchanges must be licensed; gaming with crypto subject to gambling laws
  - **South Korea**: Strict crypto regulations; NFT games face regulatory scrutiny

- **Key Regulatory Concerns**:
  - **Money Laundering**: AML/KYC requirements for crypto transactions
  - **Securities Laws**: Tokens may be classified as securities requiring registration
  - **Gambling Laws**: Games with crypto rewards may trigger gambling regulations
  - **Consumer Protection**: Disclosure requirements, fair play guarantees
  - **Tax Reporting**: Players and platforms must report crypto income

- **Play-to-Earn Models Under Scrutiny**:
  - Axie Infinity investigated in multiple jurisdictions
  - Many P2E games have ceased operations due to regulatory pressure
  - "Gaming" vs "Gambling" distinction unclear with crypto rewards
  - NFT games face additional regulatory complexity

- **Relevance**: Crypto integration with games faces significant and evolving regulatory 
  challenges. Even skill-based games may require licenses, compliance programs, and 
  geographic restrictions.

### Source 8: Legal Frameworks for Skill-Based Gaming with Prizes

- **US Legal Framework**:
  - **Dominant Factor Test**: Determines if skill or chance is primary factor
  - **Material Element Test**: Whether chance plays a material role in outcome
  - **Any Chance Test**: Any element of chance makes it gambling (strictest, few states)
  
- **Skill Game Exceptions**:
  - Tournament formats with entry fees generally permitted if skill-based
  - Prize pools from entry fees allowed in most jurisdictions for skill games
  - Marketing and presentation matter (avoid "gambling" language)
  - Age restrictions often apply (18+ or 21+)

- **Best Practices for Compliance**:
  - Clear terms of service and prize structures
  - Verifiable skill-based mechanics (no randomness in core gameplay)
  - Age verification systems
  - Geo-blocking for restricted jurisdictions
  - Legal counsel review for target markets
  - Separate virtual currency from cryptocurrency
  - Optional entry without purchase (sweepstakes model)

- **Case Studies**:
  - **DraftKings/FanDuel**: Successfully defended fantasy sports as skill games
  - **Online Poker**: Mixed results, banned in some US states despite skill elements
  - **E-sports Tournaments**: Generally legal with proper structure
  - **Casual Game Competitions**: Many operate in legal gray areas

- **Relevance**: Skill-based board games have strong legal foundation, but cryptocurrency 
  integration requires careful structuring, legal review, and compliance systems to avoid 
  gambling classification and regulatory enforcement.

### Source 9: Implementation Models Without Gambling Issues

- **Model 1: In-Game Currency Only**
  - Players wager and win only in-game currency
  - No conversion to real money or cryptocurrency
  - Similar to chips in casual poker apps
  - Lowest regulatory risk
  - Example: Final Fantasy XIV's Triple Triad uses MGP (Manderville Gold Saucer Points)

- **Model 2: Free Entry Tournaments**
  - No entry fee or wager requirement
  - Prizes awarded from platform funds, not player contributions
  - Avoids "consideration" element of gambling
  - Higher operational costs for platform
  - Example: Many e-sports tournaments with open qualifiers

- **Model 3: Cosmetic Rewards Only**
  - Winners receive cosmetic items, not currency
  - Items are non-transferable and have no market value
  - Avoids "prize of value" element in many jurisdictions
  - Limited appeal for competitive players
  - Example: Overwatch competitive mode rewards

- **Model 4: Separate Tournament System**
  - Casual play with in-game currency in main game
  - Separate licensed tournament platform for real/crypto prizes
  - Clear separation between casual and competitive play
  - Requires tournament license in most jurisdictions
  - Example: Some poker platforms (PokerStars) separate play money and real money

- **Model 5: Skill-Based Rewards**
  - Rewards based on demonstrated skill level, not wagers
  - Achievement-based crypto rewards (complete tutorials, win X games)
  - Not tied to specific game outcomes or wagers
  - May still require crypto licensing but avoids gambling classification
  - Example: Some educational platforms that reward learning with crypto

- **Relevance**: Multiple implementation models allow board games in MMORPGs while 
  managing regulatory risk. In-game currency models have lowest risk; cryptocurrency 
  integration requires careful legal structuring.

### Source 10: Game Currency to Cryptocurrency Exchange - Critical Regulatory Analysis

- **The Exchange Problem**: Converting in-game currency to cryptocurrency (ETH/BTC) or vice versa 
  creates a "bridge" between virtual and real-world value, triggering multiple regulatory frameworks:

- **Money Transmitter Licensing Requirements**:
  - **United States**: Any exchange of virtual currency for real currency (including crypto) 
    requires state-by-state Money Transmitter Licenses (MTL) in most states
  - FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) requires MSB (Money Services Business) registration
  - Each state license costs $50,000-500,000+ in legal, compliance, and bonding costs
  - Total cost for 50-state licensing: $5-10 million+ with ongoing compliance costs
  - **European Union**: Under MiCA, crypto exchanges require CASP (Crypto-Asset Service Provider) license
  - License requires ‚Ç¨50,000-125,000 in capital reserves, compliance infrastructure, AML/KYC systems
  
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC)**:
  - Full identity verification required for all users exchanging value
  - Transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting (SAR filing)
  - Customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence for high-value users
  - Record keeping requirements (5-7 years depending on jurisdiction)
  - Staff training and compliance officer requirements
  - Annual audits and regulatory examinations

- **Gambling Classification Risk with Exchange**:
  - **Key Principle**: Once in-game currency is convertible to real money/crypto, games involving 
    that currency become gambling if they have chance elements
  - Even pure skill games may face gambling licensing requirements when prizes are convertible
  - Most jurisdictions have specific gambling licenses for online gaming with real money
  - Costs: $100,000-$1,000,000+ per jurisdiction for gambling licenses
  - Ongoing compliance: Game fairness testing, player protection measures, responsible gambling features

- **Securities Law Implications**:
  - If game currency is convertible to crypto and derives value from the game/platform, it may be 
    classified as a security under SEC regulations (US) or similar frameworks (EU, Asia)
  - **Howey Test** (US): Investment of money + common enterprise + expectation of profit from others' efforts
  - If classified as security: Requires registration with SEC or exemption (Regulation A+, Regulation D)
  - Registration costs: $500,000-$2,000,000+ with ongoing reporting requirements
  - Token sales may be classified as securities offerings requiring prospectus and disclosures

- **Tax Reporting and Withholding**:
  - Exchanges may require 1099 reporting for US users (gains over $600)
  - EU VAT implications for virtual goods and services
  - Withholding obligations for foreign players
  - Platform becomes responsible for reporting users' taxable events

- **Case Studies - What Happened to Others**:
  - **Second Life (Linden Dollars)**: Initially allowed exchanges; faced regulatory scrutiny; 
    now operates through licensed third-party exchanges only; Linden Lab doesn't operate exchange directly
  - **World of Warcraft Gold**: Blizzard prohibits real-money trading; actively bans and pursues 
    legal action against gold sellers and exchanges
  - **EVE Online (PLEX)**: Allows purchase with real money but carefully structured to avoid 
    being a money transmitter; one-way conversion only (USD ‚Üí PLEX, no PLEX ‚Üí USD)
  - **Axie Infinity (SLP/AXS tokens)**: Faced regulatory investigations in Philippines, Thailand, 
    and multiple other jurisdictions; classified as securities in some regions; experienced 
    massive regulatory pressure leading to market collapse
  - **Counter-Strike Skins Gambling**: Valve shut down skin gambling sites; FTC enforcement actions 
    against sites enabling real-money trading; multiple criminal prosecutions

- **ETH as In-Game Currency - Additional Complications**:
  - **Using ETH directly in-game** creates immediate money transmitter obligations
  - Every transaction (quest rewards, NPC sales, player trades) becomes a money transmission event
  - Impossible to maintain "closed-loop" defense against gambling classification
  - All game mechanics involving ETH could be classified as gambling if any chance is involved
  - Smart contract risks: Immutable bugs, security vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance in code
  - Gas fees make micro-transactions impractical for gameplay
  - ETH price volatility disrupts game economy balance

- **Auction House with ETH/Crypto**:
  - Player-to-player trades with real crypto = peer-to-peer money transmission
  - Platform facilitating these trades = money transmitter in most jurisdictions
  - Requires full AML/KYC for every participating player
  - Platform liability for illicit transactions (money laundering, terrorist financing)
  - Must implement transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and reporting systems
  - Similar to operating a cryptocurrency exchange with all associated compliance burdens

- **Regulatory Enforcement Examples**:
  - **FinCEN Enforcement**: Fined unlicensed virtual currency exchangers $35,000-$110,000,000
  - **State Regulators**: Cease and desist orders for unlicensed money transmission
  - **Criminal Prosecution**: Federal charges for unlicensed money transmission (up to 5 years prison)
  - **Class Action Lawsuits**: Players suing platforms for losses in unregulated crypto games

- **The "Closed-Loop" Defense**:
  - Courts have recognized "closed-loop" systems where virtual currency has no real-world value
  - Once you allow conversion to crypto/real money, closed-loop defense is destroyed
  - Cannot "un-ring the bell" - even if you later disable exchange, regulatory obligations remain
  - Secondary markets (even if unofficial) can destroy closed-loop defense

**Bottom Line**: Allowing exchange between game currency and ETH/crypto, or using ETH directly 
as in-game currency, transforms a game into a **regulated financial service** requiring:
  - Money transmitter licenses (50 states in US + federal)
  - Cryptocurrency exchange licenses (MiCA in EU, similar in other regions)
  - Possibly gambling licenses if games have chance elements
  - Possibly securities registration if currency/tokens have investment characteristics
  - Full AML/KYC/CFT compliance program ($500,000-$2,000,000+ annual costs)
  - Legal and compliance staff (10-50+ employees depending on scale)
  - Ongoing regulatory examinations and audits
  - Geographic restrictions (cannot operate in many jurisdictions)
  - **Total cost**: $10,000,000-50,000,000+ in setup and first-year operations

**Recommended Alternative**: Keep game currency completely separate from cryptocurrency. If crypto 
integration is desired, use models that avoid exchange: cosmetic NFTs (non-tradeable for currency), 
achievement rewards (not earned through gameplay involving wagers), or separate licensed tournament 
platform with direct crypto prizes (not involving game currency conversion).

- **Relevance**: This is the most critical regulatory consideration for BlueMarble. Creating an 
  exchange or using ETH as in-game currency crosses from "game design question" into "operating 
  a regulated financial institution" with massive legal, financial, and operational implications.

## Implications for Design

- **Implementation Strategy for BlueMarble**:
  - Board games as tavern/social activities enhance world immersion
  - Start with in-game currency only to avoid regulatory complexity
  - Chess and Mancala recommended as first implementations (low complexity, clear skill-based)
  - Use existing open-source engines (Stockfish for chess) to reduce development time
  - Implement single-player vs. NPCs first, then add player-vs-player
  - Consider Shogi for authentic cultural content in appropriate settings

- **Cryptocurrency Integration Recommendations**:
  - **Do Not** integrate direct ETH/BTC wagering on game outcomes
  - **Do Not** create an exchange between game currency and cryptocurrency (ETH/BTC)
  - **Do Not** use ETH/BTC directly as in-game currency for gameplay transactions
  - Risk: Gambling classification in most jurisdictions
  - Risk: Money transmitter licensing required (50 states + federal in US, similar globally)
  - Risk: AML/KYC compliance requirements ($500K-$2M+ annual costs)
  - Risk: Requires gaming licenses, securities registration may be required
  - Risk: Ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions
  - **Cost**: $10M-50M+ in regulatory compliance, licensing, and infrastructure
  
- **Why Exchange is Particularly Problematic**:
  - Converts game from entertainment to regulated financial service
  - Every player transaction becomes a money transmission event requiring monitoring
  - Destroys "closed-loop" defense against gambling classification
  - Creates platform liability for money laundering and illicit transactions
  - Requires full identity verification for all players (eliminates anonymity)
  - Geographic restrictions make global MMORPG nearly impossible
  - Case studies show consistent regulatory enforcement (Axie Infinity, Second Life, skin gambling sites)
  
- **Alternative Crypto Integration Models**:
  - **Achievement Rewards**: Award crypto for reaching milestones (win 100 games, reach rating)
  - **Tournament System**: Separate licensed platform for crypto tournaments with proper compliance
  - **NFT Pieces**: Cosmetic chess/board game pieces as collectible NFTs (separate from wagering)
  - **Season Rewards**: Top players in seasonal ladders receive crypto prizes (not per-game wagering)

- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Consult gaming law attorneys before any crypto integration
  - Implement geo-blocking for restricted jurisdictions
  - Clear terms of service stating games are skill-based
  - Age verification for any prize competitions
  - Separate systems for casual play vs. competitive tournaments
  - Monitor regulatory developments in target markets

- **Design Priorities**:
  1. Implement board games with in-game currency only (Phase 1)
  2. Build player base and engagement with mini-games
  3. Evaluate regulatory landscape for target markets
  4. If crypto integration desired, pursue licensed tournament model (Phase 2)
  5. Keep casual and competitive systems clearly separated
