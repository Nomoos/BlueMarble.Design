## Approved Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Geographic Partitioning Migration Strategy

**Approach**: Phased migration by region type to minimize risk

**Migration Order** (Approved):
1. **Phase 1**: Oceanic regions (low complexity, high homogeneity)
   - Risk: LOW
   - Duration: 2 weeks
   - Validation: 95%+ compression success

2. **Phase 2**: Continental regions (medium complexity)
   - Risk: MEDIUM
   - Duration: 3 weeks
   - Validation: Consistency checks

3. **Phase 3**: Coastal regions (high complexity, high value)
   - Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Duration: 3 weeks
   - Validation: Comprehensive testing

**Total Migration Timeline**: 8-10 weeks with buffer

### 2. Parallel Systems Operation

**Dual-Write Strategy** (Approved):
- Both legacy and new systems operate simultaneously during migration
- All writes go to both systems for validation period
- Read traffic gradually shifted to new system
- Performance and consistency validation in real-time
- Minimum dual-write period: 2 weeks per phase

**Rollback Capability**:
- Instant rollback to legacy system if issues detected
- Feature flags for traffic switching
- Automated health checks and alerts

### 3. Automated Rollback Procedures

**Rollback Triggers** (Approved):
| Trigger | Threshold | Response Time | Auto-Rollback |
|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| High Error Rate | >5% | <5 minutes | ✅ Enabled |
| Performance Degradation | >100ms P95 | <10 minutes | ❌ Manual |
| Data Inconsistency | >0.1% | <2 minutes | ✅ Enabled |
| System Unavailability | >99% downtime | <1 minute | ✅ Enabled |

**Rollback Process**:
1. Automated health monitoring detects issue
2. Traffic immediately redirected to legacy system
3. New system set to read-only mode
4. Investigation and resolution
5. Gradual traffic restoration after fix validation

### 4. Real-time Monitoring

**Approved Monitoring Stack**:
- **Performance**: BenchmarkDotNet for continuous benchmarking
