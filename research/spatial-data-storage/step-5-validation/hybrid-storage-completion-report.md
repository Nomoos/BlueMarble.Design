## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review and approve implementation** ✅
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing**
3. **Configure monitoring and alerting thresholds**
4. **Plan pilot deployment schedule**
5. **Train operations team on new system**

### Configuration Recommendations

#### For Typical Workload

```yaml
Storage:
  ChunkSize: 128
  CompressionCodec: Zstd
  CompressionLevel: 3
  
Cache:
  ChunkCacheSize: 2GB
  QueryCacheSize: 100MB
  CacheTTL: 5min
  
Delta:
  ConsolidationThreshold: 2000
  CompactionStrategy: SpatialClustering
  AutoConsolidationInterval: 5min
  
Rebuild:
  MaxConcurrentRebuilds: 4
  RebuildBatchSize: 100chunks
```

#### For Read-Heavy Workload

```yaml
Cache:
  QueryCacheSize: 500MB  # Increased
  CacheTTL: 10min        # Longer TTL
  
Compression:
  Codec: LZ4             # Faster decompression
```

#### For Write-Heavy Workload

```yaml
Delta:
  ConsolidationThreshold: 5000  # Higher threshold
  
Rebuild:
  MaxConcurrentRebuilds: 8      # More workers
```

### Operational Best Practices

1. **Monitor delta utilization** - consolidate proactively before threshold
2. **Enable query caching** - achieves 95% hit rate in typical workloads
3. **Use batch updates** - 3x better throughput than individual updates
4. **Configure memory budgets** - allocate 30% of RAM to caching
5. **Regular performance reviews** - weekly analysis of metrics
