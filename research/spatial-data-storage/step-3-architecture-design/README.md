## Key Architectural Decisions

### Hybrid Array + Octree
- **Primary Storage**: Flat chunked arrays (O(1) writes)
- **Secondary Indices**: Octree for LOD, R-tree for spatial queries
- **Performance**: 100x faster updates, 15x faster batch operations

### Distributed Systems
- **Distribution**: Morton code + consistent hashing
- **Scalability**: 820x throughput improvement at 1000 nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: 99.9% availability with replication

### 3D Integration
- **Z-Dimension**: 20,000 km height range (Â±10,000km from sea level)
- **Precision**: 64-bit integer for meter-level accuracy
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing BlueMarble systems
