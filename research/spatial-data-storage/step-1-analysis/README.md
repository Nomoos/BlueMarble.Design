# Step 1: Analysis

## Overview

This step contains comprehensive analysis of spatial data storage approaches, including examination of BlueMarble's current implementation and detailed comparison of alternative strategies.

## Sub-steps

1. **Current Implementation Analysis** - Understanding existing systems
2. **Comparative Analysis** - Evaluating alternative approaches

## Research Content

- [Current Implementation](current-implementation.md) - Documentation of BlueMarble's existing spatial data architecture
- [Comparison Analysis](comparison-analysis.md) - Detailed comparison of spatial storage approaches (Octree, KD-Tree, Spatial Hash, Geohash, S2, Raster/Grid, Vector/Boundary)

## Key Findings

- BlueMarble currently uses quadtree-based spatial indexing
- Multiple storage approaches have different trade-offs for geological data
- Hybrid approaches show promise for planetary-scale simulations
- Performance requirements demand careful storage strategy selection
