## Technical Risks

### RISK-T001: Data Consistency Issues in Distributed System

**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5) - Distributed systems are inherently complex
- **Impact**: Critical (5/5) - Data inconsistency can corrupt geological simulations
- **Risk Score**: 15/25

**Description**: 
Cassandra's eventual consistency model may lead to temporary data inconsistencies, particularly during high-write scenarios when geological processes update large regions simultaneously.

**Potential Impact**:
- Incorrect material data returned to geological simulation engines
- Simulation results that don't reflect actual world state
- Player experience inconsistencies in multiplayer scenarios
- Data corruption requiring expensive recovery procedures

**Mitigation Strategies**:

```csharp
public class ConsistencyMitigationService
{
    private readonly ICassandraSession _session;
    private readonly IConsistencyValidator _validator;
    
    public class ConsistencyConfig
    {
        public ConsistencyLevel ReadConsistency { get; set; } = ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum;
        public ConsistencyLevel WriteConsistency { get; set; } = ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum;
        public TimeSpan MaxTolerableInconsistency { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
        public bool EnableReadRepair { get; set; } = true;
    }
    
    public async Task<MaterialData> ReadWithConsistencyValidation(ulong mortonCode, int level)
    {
        // Primary read with quorum consistency
        var primary = await ReadFromCassandra(mortonCode, level, ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum);
        
        // For critical geological processes, validate consistency
        if (IsCriticalOperation())
        {
            var validation = await _validator.ValidateConsistency(mortonCode, level);
            if (!validation.IsConsistent)
            {
                // Force read repair by reading from all replicas
                await ForceReadRepair(mortonCode, level);
                primary = await ReadFromCassandra(mortonCode, level, ConsistencyLevel.All);
            }
        }
        
        return primary;
    }
    
    public async Task WriteWithConsistencyGuarantee(ulong mortonCode, int level, MaterialData material)
    {
        // Use LOCAL_QUORUM for writes to ensure consistency within datacenter
        await WriteToGCassandra(mortonCode, level, material, ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum);
        
        // For critical updates, verify write was successful
        if (IsCriticalUpdate(material))
        {
            var verification = await ReadFromCassandra(mortonCode, level, ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum);
            if (!verification.Equals(material))
            {
                throw new ConsistencyException($"Write verification failed for {mortonCode}:{level}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Contingency Plans**:
1. **Automated Read Repair**: Detect and automatically repair inconsistencies
2. **Manual Consistency Checks**: Daily validation of critical data regions
3. **Rollback to Single-Node**: Emergency fallback to PostgreSQL for critical operations
4. **Data Reconciliation Tools**: Automated tools to resolve conflicts

**Monitoring and Detection**:
```yaml
consistency_monitoring:
  metrics:
    - "consistency_lag_seconds"
    - "read_repair_operations_per_hour"
    - "write_timeout_rate"
    - "hinted_handoff_queue_size"
  alerts:
    - threshold: "consistency_lag > 10 seconds"
      severity: "high"
      action: "trigger_read_repair"
    - threshold: "write_timeout_rate > 5%"
      severity: "critical"
      action: "investigate_cluster_health"
```

### RISK-T002: Performance Degradation Under Scale

**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5) - Scale testing has limitations
- **Impact**: High (4/5) - Could affect user experience significantly
- **Risk Score**: 12/25

**Description**:
Performance may degrade under real-world load patterns that differ from benchmarks, particularly when scaling beyond tested limits or encountering unexpected query patterns.

**Specific Scenarios**:
- **Hot Spotting**: Concentration of queries on specific regions (e.g., popular geological formations)
- **Memory Pressure**: Redis cache exhaustion during peak traffic
- **Network Saturation**: Inter-node communication bottlenecks
- **GC Pressure**: Java garbage collection pauses in Cassandra

**Mitigation Strategies**:

```csharp
public class PerformanceOptimizationService
{
    public class PerformanceMonitor
    {
        public async Task<PerformanceReport> AnalyzeSystemPerformance()
        {

            };
        }
    }
    
    public class AutoScalingService
    {
        public async Task HandlePerformanceDegradation(PerformanceAlert alert)
        {
            switch (alert.Type)
            {
                case AlertType.HighLatency:
                    await ScaleRedisCache();
                    await OptimizeCassandraCompaction();
                    break;
                    
                case AlertType.MemoryPressure:
                    await EvictColdDataFromRedis();
                    await AddCassandraNodes();
                    break;
                    
                case AlertType.NetworkSaturation:
                    await LoadBalanceConnections();
                    await OptimizeQueryBatching();
                    break;
                    
                case AlertType.HotSpotting:
                    await RebalanceDataDistribution();
                    await AdjustCacheStrategy();
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```yaml
performance_slas:
  query_latency:
    p50: "<1ms"
    p95: "<10ms"
    p99: "<25ms"
    breach_threshold: "5% of requests exceed SLA"

    breach_threshold: "Any downtime >5 minutes"
    
  cache_performance:
    hit_rate: ">90%"
    breach_threshold: "Hit rate <80% for >1 hour"
```

### RISK-T003: Redis Memory Limitations

**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**
- **Probability**: High (4/5) - Memory is finite resource
- **Impact**: Medium (3/5) - Cache misses increase latency but don't break functionality
- **Risk Score**: 12/25

**Description**:
Redis cache may exhaust available memory during peak usage, leading to cache evictions and subsequent performance degradation as queries fall back to Cassandra.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

```csharp
public class RedisMemoryManagementService
{
    public class MemoryOptimizationConfig
    {
        public long MaxMemoryBytes { get; set; } = 16L * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 16GB

        public TimeSpan HotDataTTL { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
        public TimeSpan ColdDataTTL { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15);
    }
    
    public async Task OptimizeMemoryUsage()
    {
        var memoryInfo = await GetRedisMemoryInfo();
        var utilizationPercent = (double)memoryInfo.UsedMemory / memoryInfo.MaxMemory;
        
        if (utilizationPercent > 0.95)
        {
            // Critical: Aggressive cache eviction
            await EvictColdRegions();
            await ReduceCacheTTL(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
        }
        else if (utilizationPercent > 0.80)
        {
            // Warning: Optimize cache strategy
            await EvictLowValueEntries();
            await OptimizeCacheKeys();
        }
    }
    
    private async Task EvictColdRegions()
    {
        // Identify and evict regions with low access frequency
        var accessPattern = await AnalyzeAccessPatterns();
        var coldRegions = accessPattern.Where(r => r.AccessFrequency < 0.01).ToList();
        
        foreach (var region in coldRegions)
        {
            await _redis.KeyDeleteAsync(region.CacheKey);
        }
    }
}
```

        cost: "$1,000/month increase"
        capacity_increase: "+32GB per instance"
```

### RISK-O002: Backup and Disaster Recovery Complexity

**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5) - Distributed systems complicate backup procedures
- **Impact**: Critical (5/5) - Data loss would be catastrophic
- **Risk Score**: 15/25

**Description**:
Backing up and recovering data from a distributed Cassandra cluster is significantly more complex than traditional database backup procedures, increasing the risk of incomplete backups or failed recovery.

**Backup Challenges**:
- Coordinating consistent snapshots across multiple nodes
- Managing large backup volumes (potentially petabytes)
- Network bandwidth limitations for backup transfers
- Point-in-time recovery complexity across distributed nodes
- Testing and validating backup integrity

**Mitigation Strategies**:

```csharp
public class DistributedBackupService
