# Spatial Data Storage Strategies for High-Resolution Global Material Mapping

## Overview

This research examines spatial data representations and storage strategies specifically for high-resolution global material mapping applications like BlueMarble's geomorphological simulation system.

The challenge of storing and efficiently querying global surface material data at high resolution requires careful consideration of storage methods, spatial indexing, and access patterns.

## Research Context

BlueMarble generates realistic terrain and coastlines through geological processes simulation. The system must handle:

- **Global Scale**: World-wide geographic data coverage
- **High Resolution**: Detailed coastal features and terrain variations  
- **Dynamic Data**: Terrain changes through geological processes over time
- **Real-time Access**: Interactive visualization and query capabilities
- **Multi-scale Visualization**: Zoom levels from global to local detail

## Storage Strategy Categories

This research analyzes five primary approaches:

1. **[Quad Tree / Octree](./comparison-analysis.md#quad-tree--octree)** - Hierarchical spatial partitioning
2. **[Binary Tree Methods](./comparison-analysis.md#binary-tree-methods)** - KD-Tree, BSP tree approaches
3. **[Hash-Based Systems](./comparison-analysis.md#hash-based-systems)** - Spatial hashing, Geohash, S2 geometry
4. **[Raster/Grid Systems](./comparison-analysis.md#rastergrid-systems)** - Traditional grid-based storage
5. **[Vector/Boundary Methods](./comparison-analysis.md#vectorboundary-methods)** - Feature-based representations

## Current BlueMarble Implementation

BlueMarble currently employs a hybrid approach:

- **Frontend**: JavaScript quadtree implementation for spatial indexing
- **Backend**: NetTopologySuite for geometric operations on polygons
- **Data Storage**: GeoPackage files for persistent geographic data
- **Coordinate System**: Global coordinate system with proper projection handling

See [Current Implementation Analysis](./current-implementation.md) for detailed documentation.

## Key Findings

### Performance Characteristics

| Approach | Best Use Case | Storage Efficiency | Query Performance | Update Complexity |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Quad/Octree | Mixed density data | High (compression) | Fast spatial queries | Medium |
| Binary Tree | Sparse point data | Medium | Fast nearest-neighbor | High (rebalancing) |
| Hash-Based | Distributed systems | Medium | Fast key lookup | Low |
| Raster/Grid | Dense uniform data | Low (fixed cells) | Very fast bulk ops | Low |
| Vector/Boundary | Sparse features | Very high | Complex queries | Medium |

### Recommendations for BlueMarble

The optimal approach for BlueMarble is a **hybrid system**:

1. **Octree for Spatial Partitioning**: Adaptive resolution, efficient compression of homogeneous regions
2. **Raster Detail Storage**: High-resolution data only at octree leaves requiring detail
3. **Spatial Hash Indexing**: For distributed access and cloud scaling capabilities
4. **Vector Boundaries**: For geological feature boundaries and coastlines

See [Detailed Recommendations](./recommendations.md) for implementation guidance.
