## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

The BlueMarble system architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It follows a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with clear separation of concerns.

**Full Documentation:** [System Architecture Design](systems/system-architecture-design.md)

**Key Features:**
- Modular service design with well-defined boundaries
- Horizontal scaling at every layer
- Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- Real-time multiplayer support
- Spherical planet simulation capabilities

**Architecture Layers:**
1. **Client Layer**: Unity/Godot game client, web client, mobile client
2. **Edge/Gateway Layer**: Load balancing, CDN, API gateway
3. **Application Services Layer**: Game services (Gateway, World, Zone, Authentication, Chat, Economy)
4. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Redis
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: Kubernetes, monitoring, logging

**Current Status:** ✅ Core architecture defined and documented

### Database Schema

The database schema supports petabyte-scale spatial data storage alongside traditional MMORPG gameplay data through a hybrid architecture.

**Full Documentation:** [Database Schema Design](systems/database-schema-design.md)

**Technology Stack:**
- **PostgreSQL 15+**: Core gameplay data (players, items, transactions)
