## Core Design Philosophy

### Geological Realism as Game Driver

**Intelligent Constraints**: Rather than arbitrary game rules, use geological reality to create natural limitations that feel logical and discoverable by players.

**Core Principle**: Every game mechanic must be grounded in authentic geological processes while providing engaging player experiences.

### Inspiration from Classic Economic Simulations

#### Port Royale 1 Adaptations
- **Dynamic Supply and Demand**: Cities have fluctuating needs based on geological resource availability
- **Trade Route Optimization**: Transport costs affected by geological terrain and infrastructure
- **Market Intelligence**: Players must understand both geological indicators and economic trends

#### The Guild 1400 Adaptations  
- **Multi-Generational Progression**: Families/dynasties develop geological expertise over time
- **Political Influence**: Guild system based on geological specializations
- **Economic Warfare**: Competition for prime geological locations and resources

### Player Freedom Framework

**Constraint-Based Design**: Players discover opportunities and limitations through geological investigation rather than arbitrary unlocks.

```python
def check_player_action_feasibility(action, location, player_resources):
    geological_constraints = analyze_geological_feasibility(action, location)
    economic_constraints = analyze_economic_feasibility(action, player_resources)
    technical_constraints = analyze_technical_requirements(action, player_expertise)
    
    return geological_constraints and economic_constraints and technical_constraints
```

## Resource Extraction (Mining) Systems

### 3D Mining Networks

**Unique Spatial Gameplay**: Using BlueMarble's octree spatial structure for genuine 3D underground networks.

#### Core Components

```csharp
public class MiningNetwork
{
    public Graph3D TunnelNetwork { get; set; }          // 3D network of connected passages
    public List<ExtractionNode> ActiveMines { get; set; }      // Active mining areas
    public List<SupportStructure> Reinforcements { get; set; } // Support systems
    public VentilationSystem AirCirculation { get; set; }      // Air management
    public DrainageSystem WaterManagement { get; set; }        // Water control
    
    public MiningPlan PlanExpansion(Coordinate3D target, GeologicalData geology)
    {
        // Realistic mining engineering
        var path = PathfindThroughGeology(CurrentExtent, target, geology);
        var supports = CalculateStructuralRequirements(path, geology);
        var ventilation = CalculateVentilationNeeds(path, CurrentNetwork);
        var drainage = CalculateWaterManagement(path, geology.WaterTable);
        
        return new MiningPlan(path, supports, ventilation, drainage);
    }
}
```

#### Mining Features

#### Extraction Mechanics

```csharp
public ExtractionResult ExtractMaterial(ExtractionNode node, ExtractionMethod method)
{
    var geology = GetLocalGeology(node.Location);
    var materialQuality = geology.GetMaterialQuality(node.Location);
    var extractionEfficiency = method.GetEfficiency(geology.Hardness);
    
    // Realistic yield calculations
    var rawYield = geology.GetAvailableMaterial(node.Location);
    var actualYield = rawYield * extractionEfficiency * QualityModifier(materialQuality);
    var byproducts = CalculateByproducts(rawYield, geology, method);
    var environmentalImpact = CalculateEnvironmentalEffects(node, method);
    
    return new ExtractionResult(actualYield, byproducts, environmentalImpact);
}
```

### Resource Discovery Systems

**Geological Survey Mechanics**: Players use realistic geological investigation methods.

#### Discovery Process

```python
def discover_resource(location, survey_method, expertise_level):
    geological_indicators = analyze_surface_geology(location)
    subsurface_prediction = apply_geological_model(indicators, expertise_level)
    actual_deposit = compare_with_true_geology(location)
    
    success_probability = min(expertise_level / required_skill, 0.95)
    return random_success(success_probability) and actual_deposit.exists
```

#### Resource Distribution

- **Copper deposits**: Associated with volcanic activity and specific rock formations

    public bool CanConstructAt(Coordinate3D location, GeologicalData geology)
    {
        // Realistic construction constraints
        if (Type == BuildingType.Mine)
        {
            return geology.HasMineralDeposits(location) && 
                   geology.IsStructurallyStable(location) &&
                   geology.GetWaterTable(location) < location.Z - MinimumDepth;
        }
        
        if (Type == BuildingType.Smelter)
        {
            return geology.HasFuelSources(location, FuelRadius) &&
                   geology.HasWaterAccess(location, WaterRadius) &&
                   geology.GetSlope(location) < MaximumSlope;
