## QA Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Ensure Functional Correctness:** All features work as specified in requirements documents
2. **Maintain Quality Standards:** Code, design, and documentation meet established quality benchmarks
3. **Prevent Regression:** New changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Optimize Performance:** Features meet performance and scalability requirements
5. **Enhance User Experience:** Features are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Unit Test Coverage | >90% | >80% |
| Integration Test Pass Rate | 100% | >95% |
| Critical Bugs in Production | 0 | <2 |
| High-Priority Bugs | <5 | <10 |
| Performance Regression | <5% | <10% |
| Documentation Completeness | 100% | >90% |
| User Acceptance Test Pass Rate | >95% | >90% |

|                  | - Isolated component tests
--------------------
```

### Test Types and Coverage

#### 1. Unit Testing

**Purpose:** Verify individual functions, methods, and components in isolation.

**Coverage Requirements:**
- All business logic functions
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling paths
- Data validation logic

**Example Test Cases:**
```gherkin
Feature: Coordinate Conversion
  Scenario: Convert valid spherical coordinates to cartesian
    Given a spherical coordinate with latitude 45.0, longitude 90.0, radius 6371000
    When converted to cartesian coordinates
    Then the result should have x, y, z values
    And converting back to spherical should match original within 0.001 tolerance

  Scenario: Handle invalid latitude values
    Given a spherical coordinate with latitude 91.0 (invalid)
    When attempting conversion
    Then should throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException
```

#### 2. Integration Testing

**Purpose:** Verify components work correctly together.

**Coverage Requirements:**
- API endpoint integration
- Database operations
- Third-party service integrations
- Module interactions

**Example Test Cases:**
```gherkin
Feature: Planet Generation API
  Scenario: Generate planet with valid configuration
    Given authenticated API client
    When POST /api/v1/planet/generate with valid config
    Then response status should be 202 Accepted
    And response should contain taskId and statusUrl
    And polling statusUrl should eventually return completed status

  Scenario: Retrieve generated planet data
    Given an existing planet with ID "planet-123"
    When GET /api/v1/planet/planet-123/polygons?format=geojson
    Then response status should be 200 OK
    And response should contain valid GeoJSON FeatureCollection
    And each feature should have biomeType property
```

#### 3. Performance Testing

**Purpose:** Ensure features meet performance requirements under load.

**Test Scenarios:**
- Load Testing: Simulate expected production load
- Stress Testing: Push system beyond normal capacity
- Endurance Testing: Sustained load over extended period
- Spike Testing: Sudden traffic increases

**Performance Targets:**

| Operation | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| API Response Time (p95) | <100ms | <200ms |
| Planet Generation (Earth-size) | <10min | <15min |
| Database Query Time | <50ms | <100ms |
| Concurrent Users | 10,000 | 15,000 |
| Memory Usage per Request | <50MB | <100MB |

#### 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Purpose:** Validate features meet user expectations and requirements.

**Process:**
1. Identify user personas and scenarios
2. Create UAT test plans based on user stories
3. Conduct testing with representative users
4. Collect feedback and iterate
5. Sign-off from stakeholders

#### 5. Regression Testing

**Purpose:** Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.

**Strategy:**
- Automated regression test suite runs on every commit
- Critical path testing for major releases
- Full regression testing before production deployment
- Monitoring of key metrics post-deployment

**Title:** Planet generation times out for large plate counts  
**Reported By:** Jane Smith  
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Severity:** S2 (High)  

**Environment:**
- Version: v1.2.3
- Platform: Linux Ubuntu 22.04
- Configuration: PlateCount=30, RadiusMeters=6371000

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Send POST /api/v1/planet/generate with PlateCount=30
2. Wait for generation to complete
3. After 20 minutes, request times out

**Expected Behavior:**
