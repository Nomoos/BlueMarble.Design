## Core Game Mechanics

### Protection Effectiveness Hierarchy

| Method | Effectiveness | Cost | Time Investment |
|--------|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Personal Patrol | 90% | None | High |
| Hired Guards (Players) | 85% | High | None |
| Hired Guards (NPCs) | 75% | Medium | None |
| Automated Defense | 60-65% | High | None |
| Diplomatic Protection | 70% | Variable | Relationship |

### NPC Behavioral Types

1. **Guard** - Combat specialists (base pay: 10 currency/hour)
2. **Trader** - Commerce focused (base pay: 15 currency/hour)
3. **Builder** - Construction experts (base pay: 12 currency/hour)
4. **Explorer** - Discovery oriented (base pay: 14 currency/hour)
5. **Miner** - Resource extraction (base pay: 11 currency/hour)
6. **Transporter** - Logistics specialists (base pay: 13 currency/hour)

### Smart NPC Decision-Making

NPCs use a payment/distance ratio optimization algorithm:
- Consider jobs within 24h walking distance (~120km)
- Calculate effective pay rate including travel time
- Prioritize best-paid jobs closest to current location
- Refuse jobs below base pay requirements

### Patrol Patterns

1. **Perimeter Patrol** - Walk edges of zone with strategic stop points
2. **Random Patrol** - Visit random points within zone
3. **Spiral Patrol** - Spiral pattern from center outward

## Economic Balance

### Anti-Exploitation Measures

1. **Distance Limits**: NPCs only consider jobs within reasonable range
2. **Minimum Pay Requirements**: Prevents guard exploitation
3. **Resource Scarcity**: Finite deposits require exploration
4. **Maintenance Costs**: All systems require upkeep
5. **Performance Tracking**: Guard ratings affect hire rates

### Cost Structures

**Personal Patrol:**
- Cost: 0 currency
- Time: High (active presence required)
- Effectiveness: 90%

**NPC Guards:**
- Cost: 10-15 currency/hour
- Time: None (automated)
- Effectiveness: 75%

**Automated Defense:**
- Initial: 1,000-5,000 currency
- Maintenance: 50-200 currency/day
- Effectiveness: 60-65%

## Player Freedom Systems

### Mining Economics

**Initial Investment:**
- Territory Claim: 1,000 - 10,000 currency
- Basic Tools: 500 currency
- Workers: 300 currency per worker

**Operating Costs:**
- Tool Maintenance: 50-100 currency/day
- Worker Wages: 10-15 currency/hour
- Protection: Variable

### Building Types

**Production:**
- Mines (resource extraction)
- Factories (processing)
- Refineries (advanced processing)

**Storage:**
- Warehouses (inventory)
- Vaults (secure storage)

**Defense:**
- Watch Towers (surveillance)
- Defense Turrets (automated defense)
- Guard Houses (guard accommodation)

**Support:**
- Housing (worker accommodation)
- Market Stalls (trading)

## Implementation Requirements

### Server-Side Systems
- Position tracking (player locations)
- Patrol path validation
- Threat detection algorithms
- NPC AI decision-making engine
- Contract management
- Real-time statistics collection
- Resource node management
- Building construction tracking
- Trading and escrow systems

### Client-Side Systems
- Interactive zone/path editor
- Real-time patrol visualization
- Threat alert notifications
- Guard hiring interface
- Performance dashboards
- Resource visualization
- Trade interface
- Economic dashboards

### Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
- `patrol_zones` - Zone definitions and configurations
- `patrol_stats` - Real-time patrol statistics
- `guard_contracts` - Guard employment contracts
- `resource_nodes` - Minable resource locations
- `buildings` - Player-constructed buildings
- `trade_orders` - Trade transactions

## Design Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Meaningful Player Choices
- Multiple protection strategies with trade-offs
- No "correct" answer - situational optimization
- Risk vs reward balancing

### 2. Economic Balance
- Natural constraints prevent exploitation
- Higher effectiveness = higher cost or time
- Sustainable resource management

### 3. Smart NPC Behavior
- Logical decision-making based on incentives
- Distance-based job evaluation
- Diverse NPC personalities

### 4. Emergent Gameplay
- Player-created protection strategies
- Combination methods for optimal coverage
- Dynamic threat response

### 5. Player Freedom
- Sandbox elements within structured systems
- Economic systems drive decision-making
- Multiple progression paths
