## Overview

### Purpose
BlueMarble aims to create a compelling MMORPG experience that captures the social aspects and progression satisfaction of classic MMORPGs while incorporating modern design principles for accessibility and engagement.

### Scope
This document covers the core game systems, player progression, world design principles, and social features that define the BlueMarble experience.

### Target Audience
- Primary: MMORPG enthusiasts aged 18-35
- Secondary: Social gamers seeking collaborative experiences
- Tertiary: New players interested in accessible MMO gameplay

## Design Goals

### Primary Goals
- Create meaningful player progression that feels rewarding
- Foster genuine community and social connections
- Build a living world that responds to player actions
- Provide both casual and hardcore gameplay options

### Secondary Goals
- Implement accessible design for diverse player abilities
- Support multiple playstyles and preferences
- Create systems that encourage positive player behavior
- Build sustainable long-term engagement

### Success Metrics
- Player retention: 70% after 30 days, 40% after 90 days
- Social engagement: Average of 3 meaningful social interactions per session
- Content completion: 80% of players complete tutorial and first major quest line

## Core Mechanics

### Character Progression
**Description:** Players advance through a hybrid class/skill system that allows specialization while maintaining flexibility
**Player Actions:** Gain experience through various activities, allocate skill points, choose specializations
**System Response:** Unlock new abilities, increase character power, provide visual progression feedback
**Edge Cases:** Skill point refunding, multi-character progression, legacy character handling

### Social Systems
**Description:** Integrated guild, friend, and mentorship systems that reward positive community behavior
**Player Actions:** Join guilds, make friends, help other players, participate in group activities
**System Response:** Provide social rewards, facilitate group formation, track reputation
**Edge Cases:** Conflict resolution, harassment reporting, cross-server social connections

### Dynamic World Events
**Description:** Server-wide events that respond to collective player actions and create shared experiences
**Player Actions:** Participate in events, make choices that affect outcomes, coordinate with other players
**System Response:** Generate appropriate events, track participation, implement consequences
**Edge Cases:** Low participation events, conflicting player choices, technical failures during events

## Player Experience

### User Flow
1. **Character Creation**: Tutorial introduction to world and basic mechanics
2. **Early Game**: Guided experience learning core systems with optional help
3. **Mid Game**: Open-ended exploration with social system introduction
4. **End Game**: Complex content requiring coordination and advanced mastery

### Player Feedback
- Visual and audio feedback for all significant actions
- Progress indicators for long-term goals
- Social recognition for achievements and helpful behavior
- Clear communication of system changes and updates

### Learning Curve
- Intuitive basic controls accessible to new players
- Progressive complexity introduction
- Optional advanced tutorials for complex systems
- Community-driven learning resources and mentorship

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Support for 1000+ concurrent players per server
- Sub-100ms response time for critical actions
- 60 FPS on mid-range hardware configurations
- Graceful degradation for lower-end systems

### Data Requirements
- Player character data with full progression history
- Real-time world state synchronized across all players
- Social graph data for friends, guilds, and relationships
- Comprehensive analytics for balance and engagement

### Integration Points
- Chat and communication systems
- Economic marketplace and trading
- Guild management and progression
- Event scheduling and coordination

## Balancing and Tuning
