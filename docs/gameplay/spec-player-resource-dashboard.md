# Player Resource Dashboard Feature Specification

**Document Type:** Feature Specification  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** BlueMarble Design Team  
**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** Draft  
**Epic/Theme:** Player Experience & UI Systems  
**Priority:** Medium

## Executive Summary

The Player Resource Dashboard is a unified interface that provides players with a comprehensive view of all their collected resources, materials, and currencies. This feature addresses the need for players to quickly understand their current resource inventory without navigating through multiple menus, improving the overall user experience and facilitating better decision-making in resource management and crafting activities.

## Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

Players currently need to navigate through multiple inventory screens and menus to understand their total resource availability. This fragmented approach creates friction in gameplay, especially when planning crafting projects, trading, or resource gathering expeditions. Players need a centralized view to make informed decisions about resource allocation and gameplay priorities.

### Solution Summary

Implement a dedicated Resource Dashboard accessible from the main HUD that displays:
- All collected resources with current quantities
- Resource categories (minerals, wood, food, etc.)
- Quick access to related systems (crafting, trading, storage)
- Resource trending and consumption rates
- Low stock alerts and recommendations

### User Stories

- As a player, I want to see all my resources in one place so that I can quickly assess what I have available
- As a crafter, I want to know what materials I'm missing for recipes so that I can plan my gathering activities
- As a trader, I want to identify surplus resources so that I can make profitable trading decisions
- As a resource gatherer, I want to track my collection rates so that I can optimize my farming routes

## User Experience Design

### User Flow

```
Main HUD → Resource Dashboard Button → Dashboard Opens
  ↓
Category Selection / Search → Resource List View
  ↓
Select Resource → Detailed Resource View
  ↓
Action Selection (Craft / Trade / Find / Store)
```

### Interface Requirements

- Tabbed interface for resource categories
- Grid view with resource icons and quantities
- Detail panel that slides in from the right when resource is selected
- Search bar at the top with filter dropdowns
- Quick stats panel showing total categories and low stock count
- Mini-map integration showing nearest gathering locations

### Wireframes/Mockups

Reference: `/assets/mockups/resource-dashboard/` (to be created)

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Overview

- Client-side caching of resource data with periodic sync
- Server authoritative resource quantities
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for resource changes
- Local storage for UI preferences (sort order, filters, etc.)

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request | Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| GET | /api/player/resources | Get all player resources | - | Resource list with quantities |
| GET | /api/player/resources/{id} | Get resource details | Resource ID | Detailed resource info |
| GET | /api/player/resources/stats | Get consumption statistics | Time range | Usage statistics |
| POST | /api/player/resources/track | Track resource view | Resource ID | Success confirmation |

### Data Model

```json
{
  "resourceId": "string (UUID)",
  "name": "string",
  "category": "enum",
  "quantity": "integer",
  "rarity": "enum",
  "icon": "string (URL)",
  "description": "string",
  "storageLocations": [
    {
      "location": "string",
      "quantity": "integer"
    }
  ],
  "consumptionRate": {
    "daily": "float",
    "weekly": "float"
  },
  "marketValue": "integer",
  "isTraded": "boolean"
}
```

### Third-Party Integrations

- None required (all internal systems)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases

1. **Display All Resources**
   - Preconditions: Player has collected various resources
   - Steps: Open Resource Dashboard
   - Expected Result: All resources displayed correctly with accurate quantities

2. **Search Functionality**
   - Preconditions: Dashboard is open with multiple resources
   - Steps: Enter resource name in search bar
   - Expected Result: Filtered list shows only matching resources

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Preconditions: Dashboard is open
   - Steps: Gather a new resource or consume an existing one
   - Expected Result: Dashboard updates immediately without refresh

4. **Performance with Large Inventory**
   - Preconditions: Test account with 1000+ resource types
   - Steps: Open Dashboard
   - Expected Result: Loads in under 1 second, smooth scrolling

### Edge Cases

- Player with zero resources (empty state with tutorial prompts)
- Player with maximum resources (999,999+ of a single type)
- Network disconnection while viewing dashboard
- Rapid resource changes (gathering many items quickly)
- Resource deleted/deprecated from game while in inventory

### Performance Testing

- Load testing with 100+ concurrent users accessing dashboard
- Stress testing with 10,000+ unique resource types
- Network latency simulation (100ms, 500ms, 1000ms)
- Memory profiling for long dashboard sessions

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Performance issues with large inventories | Medium | High | Implement virtualized scrolling and pagination |
| Real-time sync complexity | Medium | Medium | Use proven WebSocket library with fallback polling |
| UI clutter with too much information | High | Medium | Iterative design with user testing, progressive disclosure |
| Security vulnerabilities in resource display | Low | High | Server-side validation, read-only client display |

## Dependencies

- Player inventory system must be complete
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- Resource database schema finalized
- Icon library for all resource types

## Success Metrics
