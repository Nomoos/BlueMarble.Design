# Player Progression System Specification

**Document Type:** Feature Specification  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Game Design Team  
**Date:** 2024-12-29  
**Status:** Draft  
**Epic/Theme:** Core Gameplay Systems  
**Priority:** High

## Executive Summary

The player progression system provides meaningful advancement paths for BlueMarble players through a hybrid class/skill system that balances specialization with flexibility. Players gain experience through diverse activities and allocate skill points to customize their character's abilities while maintaining the option to explore different playstyles.

## Feature Overview

### Problem Statement
Players need a progression system that provides clear advancement goals, meaningful choices, and the flexibility to adapt their character build as they learn and explore the game world.

### Solution Summary
A dual-track progression system combining character levels (providing base stats and access) with skill points (providing specialization and customization). Players can redistribute skill points with limitations to encourage thoughtful choices while allowing experimentation.

### User Stories
- As a new player, I want clear progression goals so that I understand how to advance my character
- As an experienced player, I want meaningful build choices so that I can customize my playstyle
- As a social player, I want to see my friends' progression so that we can plan activities together
- As a competitive player, I want to optimize my build so that I can perform effectively in challenging content

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Character Level System**
   - Description: Traditional level-based progression from 1-50 with exponential experience requirements
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Experience gains from all major gameplay activities (combat, crafting, exploration, social)
     - [ ] Level progression unlocks new areas, quests, and features
     - [ ] Visual feedback for level advancement including animations and notifications

2. **Skill Point Allocation**
   - Description: Players earn skill points separately from levels and allocate them across skill trees
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Multiple skill trees representing different character aspects (combat, crafting, social, utility)
     - [ ] Skill point allocation interface with preview and confirmation
     - [ ] Skill dependencies and prerequisites system

3. **Build Flexibility System**
   - Description: Limited ability to redistribute skill points to encourage experimentation
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Skill point reset consumable items available through gameplay
     - [ ] Free respec options during tutorial and early levels
     - [ ] Warning system for major character changes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Character progression calculations must complete within 100ms
- **Scalability:** System must support future expansion to level 100+
- **Security:** Skill point allocation must be server-validated to prevent cheating
- **Accessibility:** Progression interface must support screen readers and colorblind players

## User Experience Design

### User Flow
```
1. Player gains experience from activity
2. Experience bar fills with visual/audio feedback
3. Upon level up: celebration animation, stat increases, skill points awarded
4. Player opens skill interface to allocate points
5. Player previews changes and confirms allocation
6. Character sheet updates with new abilities/stats
```

### Interface Requirements
- Skill tree visualization with interconnected nodes
- Experience bar with progress indication and time-to-level estimates
- Character stat summary showing progression impact
- Build comparison tools for evaluating changes

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Overview
- Client-side prediction for immediate feedback with server validation
- Database storage of progression state with audit logging
- Real-time synchronization for group activities requiring current stats

### Data Model
```
PlayerProgression {
  playerId: UUID
  currentLevel: Integer
  currentExperience: BigInteger
  skillPoints: {
    available: Integer
    allocated: Map<SkillId, Integer>
    lifetime: Integer
  }
  progressionHistory: List<ProgressionEvent>
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- Cached skill calculations for frequently accessed builds
- Batch experience updates for multi-source gains
- Progressive loading of skill tree data

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Progression**
   - Preconditions: New character at level 1
   - Steps: Complete tutorial activities to gain experience
   - Expected Result: Character reaches level 2 with appropriate skill points

2. **Skill Allocation**
   - Preconditions: Character with unallocated skill points
   - Steps: Open skill interface, allocate points, confirm changes
   - Expected Result: Character stats update, skill points consumed

3. **Skill Redistribution**
   - Preconditions: Character with allocated skills and respec item
   - Steps: Use respec item, reallocate skill points
   - Expected Result: Previous allocation cleared, new allocation applied

### Edge Cases
- Experience overflow during level-up calculations
- Skill point allocation during server connection issues
- Character progression during group activities with varying levels

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Engagement**: 80% of players actively allocate skill points within first week
- **Retention**: Progression system contributes to 70% player retention at 30 days
- **Satisfaction**: Player surveys show 7+ satisfaction rating for progression system

### Analytics Requirements
- Track experience sources and player activity patterns
- Monitor skill allocation choices and respec usage
- Measure time-to-level and progression pacing

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Character creation and tutorial systems
- Activity reward systems (combat, crafting, etc.)
- User interface framework

### External Dependencies
- Database infrastructure for persistence
- Real-time networking for group progression sync

## Out of Scope

- Guild or group progression systems
- Achievement or trophy systems
- Seasonal or temporary progression events
- Cross-character account-wide progression

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Skill Tree Structure
- Combat Skills: Weapon specializations, defensive abilities
- Crafting Skills: Production efficiency, quality improvements  
- Social Skills: Group bonuses, communication enhancements
- Utility Skills: Movement, inventory, convenience features
