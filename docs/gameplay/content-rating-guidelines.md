## Target Rating

### Primary Target: ESRB Teen (13+) / PEGI 12

**Rationale:**
- Accessible to teenage and adult audiences
- Allows for complex historical/geological themes
- Permits moderate fantasy violence
- Supports educational content about medieval life
- Aligns with target demographic (see [Core Game Design](gdd-core-game-design.md))

**Rating Descriptors Expected:**
- **ESRB:** Fantasy Violence, Mild Blood, Mild Language, Use of Alcohol (historical context)
- **PEGI:** Violence, In-Game Purchases

### Alternative Ratings Considered

**ESRB Everyone 10+ / PEGI 7** - Rejected
- Too restrictive for realistic medieval simulation
- Limits educational content about historical warfare/conflict
- Constrains authentic geological hazard representation

**ESRB Mature 17+ / PEGI 18** - Rejected
- Unnecessarily excludes teenage audience
- Not required for BlueMarble's simulation focus
- Conflicts with educational/accessible design goals

---

## Content Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Historical Authenticity Without Exploitation**
- Represent medieval life realistically but tastefully
- Include historically accurate elements (guilds, trade, social structures)
- Avoid gratuitous depiction of historical violence or suffering
- Focus on systems and simulation rather than graphic content

**2. Educational Value**
- Geology, mineralogy, and Earth sciences take priority
- Historical crafting and technology presented authentically
- Social systems teach about medieval economics and cooperation
- Content should inform and inspire curiosity

**3. Inclusive and Welcoming**
- Avoid content that excludes or marginalizes players
- Represent diverse player characters and NPCs
- No stereotyping or objectification
- Foster positive community culture

**4. Simulation Over Spectacle**
- Emphasize systems, choices, and consequences
- Violence serves gameplay purpose, not entertainment
- Relationships focus on social bonds and cooperation
- Content supports game mechanics, not shock value

## Research Context

### Why We Study Mature-Rated Games

BlueMarble's research includes analysis of mature-rated games (The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077) for specific design lessons:

**What We Learn:**
- ✅ Quest structure and branching narratives
- ✅ Player agency and meaningful choices
- ✅ Content design workflows and templates
- ✅ Long-term consequence systems
- ✅ Investigation mechanics and clue-finding
- ✅ Multiple solution paths for problems

**What We Don't Adopt:**
- ❌ Mature sexual content
- ❌ Graphic violence or gore
- ❌ Strong profanity
- ❌ Adult themes or situations
- ❌ M-rated content of any kind

**Example: The Witcher 3 Analysis**

From [content-design-video-game-rpgs.md](../../research/game-design/step-1-foundation/content-design/content-design-video-game-rpgs.md):

**We Study:**
- "Morally gray choices" → Applied to resource management decisions
- "Delayed consequences" → Applied to geological/economic systems
- "Contract quests as template" → Applied to survey/crafting missions
- "Investigation mechanics" → Applied to mineral prospecting

**We Ignore:**
- Mature relationship content
- Graphic violence
- Adult language
- M-rated themes

**The Line:** We learn **content design techniques** from mature games without importing **mature content**.

### Game Research Summary

| Game | Rating | What We Learn | What We Don't Use |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| The Witcher 3 | M | Quest structure, choices | Mature themes, violence, romance |
| Cyberpunk 2077 | M | Multiple solutions, density tiers | Mature content, explicit themes |
| Kingdom Come | M | Historical authenticity | Graphic violence, mature themes |
| Baldur's Gate 3 | M | Player agency, reactivity | Mature romance, violence |
| Gothic Series | T | World reactivity, exploration | Some violence depictions |

**Key Insight:** Professional content design patterns are separate from content rating. We study AAA quest design without adopting M-rated content.
