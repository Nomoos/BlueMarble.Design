## Selling Items

### Creating a Listing

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open your Inventory** (press `I`)
2. **Right-click the item** you want to sell
3. **Select "List on Marketplace"**
4. **Set your price**:
   - Enter price per unit (not total price)
   - Preview shows total revenue after fees
5. **Choose quantity** to sell (or entire stack)
6. **Select listing duration**:
   - 1 Day (good for urgent sales)
   - 3 Days (standard duration)
   - 7 Days (for rare/expensive items)
   - Until Sold (premium feature)
7. **Review listing fee** (typically 1-5% of list price)
8. **Click "Create Listing"**

**Your item is now listed!** The items are locked in your inventory (shown with a "Listed" tag) and can't be used until
sold or listing cancelled.

#### Pricing Strategy

**Check Market Prices:**

- View the **Price History** button before listing
- See current lowest, highest, and average prices
- Aim slightly below average for fast sales
- Price at average for fair market value
- Price above average for premium/rare items

**Consider These Factors:**

- Item quality and attributes
- Current market demand
- Your seller reputation (high rep can command higher prices)
- Time sensitivity (need gold now vs. maximize profit)

**Pro Tip:** Items listed 5-10% below market average sell 3x faster!

#### Listing Fees

Listing fees prevent spam and maintain marketplace quality:

| List Price | Fee Percentage | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 0-100 gold | 1% | 1 gold fee on 100 gold item |
| 101-1000 gold | 2% | 20 gold fee on 1000 gold item |
| 1001-10000 gold | 3% | 300 gold fee on 10000 gold item |
| 10001+ gold | 5% | 500 gold fee on 10000 gold item |

**Note:** Fees are non-refundable, even if item doesn't sell. Choose your price wisely!

## Cross-Island Trading

### How It Works

BlueMarble's world consists of multiple islands. When you buy from a seller on a different island, items must be
transported via the shipping system.

#### Transport Costs

Calculated based on:

- **Distance**: Further islands cost more
- **Item Weight**: Heavier items cost more per unit
- **Volume**: Bulk purchases may get discounts
- **Express Delivery**: Optional faster shipping (2x cost)

**Example Transport Costs:**

```text
Same Island:        0 gold (instant transfer)
Adjacent Island:    5-10 gold (2 hour delivery)
Distant Island:    15-25 gold (6 hour delivery)
Remote Island:     30-50 gold (12 hour delivery)
```

#### Delivery Times

- **Same Island**: Instant (items appear immediately)
- **Adjacent Islands**: 2-4 hours
- **Distant Islands**: 6-8 hours
- **Remote Islands**: 12-24 hours

**Express Delivery:** Available for 2x transport cost, reduces time by 50%

#### Tracking Deliveries

1. After purchase, check **Marketplace > Deliveries**
2. See estimated delivery time
3. Receive notification when items arrive
4. Items automatically added to inventory

### Regional Price Differences

Different islands may have different prices for the same items due to:

- Local resource availability
- Regional demand
- Shipping costs

**Arbitrage Opportunity:** Buy low on one island, sell high on another! Factor in transport costs and time for profit.

## Reputation and Trust

### Building Your Reputation

Your reputation is your most valuable asset as a marketplace seller.

#### Rating System

After each transaction, buyers can rate sellers:

- **1-5 Stars**: Overall satisfaction
- **Written Review**: Optional comment
- **Transaction Tags**: Fast Shipping, Good Communication, etc.

**Your Rating Affects:**

- Buyer trust and willingness to purchase
- Search result ranking (higher ratings shown first)
- Ability to earn trust badges
- Access to premium seller features

#### Trust Badges

Earn badges by maintaining high standards:

- **Trusted Seller**: 50+ transactions, 4.5+ rating
- **Fast Shipper**: 90% of orders completed within 2 hours
- **Fair Prices**: Consistently priced within 10% of market average
- **Reliable Trader**: 98%+ completion rate
- **Veteran Merchant**: 500+ transactions, member 6+ months

#### Tips for High Ratings

1. **Price Fairly**: Don't overprice significantly above market
2. **Accurate Descriptions**: Ensure item details match listing
3. **Fast Fulfillment**: Items auto-fulfill, but quick response builds trust
4. **Good Communication**: Respond to buyer questions promptly
5. **Honor Sales**: Don't cancel sold listings (major reputation hit)

### Rating Sellers

After purchasing, you can rate your experience:

1. Go to **Transaction History**
2. Find the completed purchase
3. Click **"Rate Seller"**
4. Choose 1-5 stars
5. Optionally add comment
6. Submit review

**Be Fair:** Consider price, item quality, and seller communication. Ratings significantly impact seller success.
