## Executive Summary

The Spherical Planet Generation and Projection System implements algorithms for generating realistic spherical planet surfaces and converting them to 2D maps with proper mathematical projections. This system builds upon BlueMarble's existing NetTopologySuite spatial operations and GeomorphologicalProcess architecture to provide scientifically accurate planetary terrain generation with seamless world-wrapping capabilities.

The system enables the creation of diverse planetary landscapes with realistic continental structures, biome distributions, and topographical features while maintaining compatibility with the established SRID_METER (4087) coordinate system for consistent spatial operations across the BlueMarble ecosystem.

## Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

BlueMarble currently operates with 2D spatial data structures that limit the realism and scientific accuracy of planetary terrain generation. The lack of spherical planet generation capabilities restricts the creation of realistic continental distributions, biome patterns, and topographical features that would occur on an actual spherical planetary body. Additionally, there is no integrated system for converting spherical planetary data to various 2D map projections for visualization and gameplay purposes.

### Solution Summary

A comprehensive planetary generation system consisting of four core components:
1. **SphericalPlanetGenerator** - Creates realistic planetary surfaces using spherical Voronoi distribution
2. **BiomeClassifier** - Implements scientific climate-based biome classification
3. **MapProjections** - Provides mathematical projection utilities for 2D map conversion
4. **SeamlessWorldWrapper** - Handles global map edge cases and world-wrapping topology

### User Stories
