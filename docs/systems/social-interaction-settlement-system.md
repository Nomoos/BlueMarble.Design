# BlueMarble - Social Interaction and Settlement Management System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Author:** BlueMarble Systems Team  
**Status:** Implemented

## Executive Summary

This document describes the comprehensive social interaction and settlement management system for BlueMarble MMORPG. The system is built around influence-based control mechanics, diplomatic relationships, and community/federative infrastructure inspired by The Guild and classic MMORPG social systems.

## Core Design Philosophy

The system is founded on the principle that settlements are controlled by entities (players, guilds, dynasties, alliances) with sufficient resources to maintain control. Control is measured through three types of influence:

- **Political Influence**: Diplomatic relationships, reputation, and social standing
- **Economic Influence**: Trade control, resource management, and wealth
- **Military Influence**: Defense capabilities, military strength, and tactical power

## System Architecture

### InfluenceProfile

The InfluenceProfile manages the three types of influence for any entity in the game.

#### Properties
```csharp
public class InfluenceProfile
{
    public Guid EntityId { get; set; }
    public float PoliticalInfluence { get; set; }  // 0.0 - 100.0
    public float EconomicInfluence { get; set; }   // 0.0 - 100.0
    public float MilitaryInfluence { get; set; }   // 0.0 - 100.0
    
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, float> InfluenceModifiers { get; set; }
}
```

#### Key Methods
- `GetTotalInfluence()`: Returns aggregate influence score across all three types
- `GetInfluenceType(InfluenceType type)`: Returns specific influence type value
- `ModifyInfluence(InfluenceType type, float amount, string reason)`: Adjusts influence with tracking
- `CalculateEffectiveInfluence(DiplomaticStatus status)`: Returns influence adjusted for diplomatic relationships

#### Influence Accumulation
- **Political**: Gained through diplomatic relationships, reputation quests, and settlement governance
- **Economic**: Gained through trade, resource control, market dominance, and taxation
- **Military**: Gained through military victories, defense structures, and army strength

#### Influence Decay
- Influence naturally decays over time if not maintained
- Base decay rate: 1% per day
- Active maintenance through gameplay prevents decay
- Diplomatic penalties can accelerate decay

### Settlement System

Settlements are the core territorial units that entities compete to control.

#### Settlement Properties
```csharp
public class Settlement
{
    public Guid SettlementId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public SettlementType Type { get; set; }
    
    // Control
    public Guid ControlledBy { get; set; }
    public DateTime ControlEstablished { get; set; }
    public float ControlStability { get; set; }  // 0.0 - 100.0
    
    // Requirements
    public InfluenceRequirements Requirements { get; set; }
    
    // Population
    public int CurrentPopulation { get; set; }
    public int MaxPopulation { get; set; }
    public float PopulationGrowthRate { get; set; }
    public float PopulationHappiness { get; set; }
    
    // Economy
    public float EconomicOutput { get; set; }
    public float TaxIncome { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<ResourceType, float> ResourceProduction { get; set; }
    
    // Location
    public GeographicLocation Location { get; set; }
    public float InfluenceRadius { get; set; }
    
    // Infrastructure
    public List<Building> Buildings { get; set; }
    public List<DefenseStructure> Defenses { get; set; }
}
```

#### Settlement Control Mechanics

##### Establishing Control
1. Entity must meet minimum influence requirements for settlement type
2. Settlement must not be currently controlled OR controller's influence has fallen below requirements
3. Entity pays establishment cost (resources, currency)
4. Control is granted with initial stability of 50%

##### Maintaining Control
- Controller must maintain influence above requirements
- Control stability increases with:
  - Population happiness
  - Economic prosperity
  - Successful defense against challenges
  - Diplomatic support from allies
- Control stability decreases with:
  - Influence falling below requirements
  - Population unhappiness
  - Failed defense attempts
  - Diplomatic isolation or hostility

##### Control Transfer
Control automatically transfers when:
1. An entity with higher total influence challenges the current controller
2. Current controller's influence falls below 50% of requirements
3. Settlement is captured through military conquest
4. Controller voluntarily transfers control

Transfer Process:
1. Challenge period announced (24-72 hours)
2. Current controller can defend by increasing influence
3. Challengers can increase their influence to strengthen claim
4. Highest influence entity gains control at end of period
5. Population and stability adjust based on transfer circumstances

### SettlementManager

The SettlementManager handles all settlement operations and lifecycle management.

#### Key Responsibilities
- Settlement creation and destruction
- Control validation and transfers
- Population management and growth
- Economic calculations and distribution
- Conflict resolution between competing entities

#### Core Methods

##### EstablishSettlement
```csharp
public Settlement EstablishSettlement(
    Guid entityId, 
    SettlementType type, 
    GeographicLocation location,
    string name)
{
    // Validate influence requirements
    // Check location availability
    // Deduct establishment costs
    // Create settlement with initial values
    // Register with influence system
    // Return settlement instance
}
```

##### ProcessPopulationGrowth
```csharp
public void ProcessPopulationGrowth(Settlement settlement, float deltaTime)
{
    // Calculate base growth rate
    // Apply happiness modifiers
    // Apply resource availability modifiers
    // Apply disease/disaster effects
    // Update population
    // Trigger events if population milestones reached
}
```

##### ValidateControl
```csharp
public bool ValidateControl(Settlement settlement)
{
    // Get controller's current influence
    // Compare against settlement requirements
    // Check for valid challengers
    // Return control validity
}
```

##### ChallengeControl
```csharp
public bool ChallengeControl(
    Settlement settlement, 
    Guid challengerId)
{
    // Verify challenger has sufficient influence
    // Check diplomatic restrictions
    // Initiate challenge period
    // Notify involved parties
    // Return challenge success
}
```

##### TransferControl
```csharp
public void TransferControl(
    Settlement settlement, 
    Guid newControllerId,
    TransferType transferType)
{
    // Record transfer in history
    // Update settlement controller
    // Adjust population happiness
    // Apply transfer penalties/bonuses
    // Notify diplomatic system
    // Update influence calculations
}
```

#### Population Management

##### Population Growth Factors
- **Base Growth Rate**: 2-5% per month depending on settlement type
- **Happiness Modifier**: -50% to +100% based on population happiness (0-100)
- **Resource Availability**: -75% to +25% based on food and essential resources
- **Disease/Disaster**: -100% to 0% during negative events
- **Immigration**: Bonus growth from successful settlements attracting new residents

##### Population Happiness Factors
- **Tax Rate**: Lower taxes increase happiness (high taxes: -20%, low taxes: +10%)
- **Resource Availability**: Sufficient food, water, housing (+15% each)
- **Security**: Strong defenses and low crime (+10%)
- **Economic Opportunity**: Trade and employment (+10%)
- **Cultural Development**: Buildings, events, governance (+15%)
- **Controller Efficiency**: How well controller maintains requirements (+20%)

##### Economic Output Calculation
```
EconomicOutput = (Population * BaseOutputPerCapita) * 
                 HappinessMultiplier * 
                 InfrastructureBonus * 
                 TypeSpecialization
                 
BaseOutputPerCapita = 0.1 - 0.5 currency/day depending on settlement type
HappinessMultiplier = 0.5 - 1.5 based on population happiness
InfrastructureBonus = 1.0 - 2.0 based on buildings and improvements
TypeSpecialization = Settlement-specific bonuses (e.g., Trading Post = 1.5x)
```

## Diplomatic System
