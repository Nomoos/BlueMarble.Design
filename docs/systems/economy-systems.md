Modified Score = Total Score × Account Age Multiplier (1.0-1.2)

Final Score = min(1000, Modified Score)
```

Account age multiplier increases by 0.1 per year of account age, up to a maximum of 1.2× bonus.

### Faction Reputation System

Faction Reputation tracks player standing with various organizations, guilds, and factions within BlueMarble. This
system provides depth to world interactions and unlocks unique content based on player choices and actions.

#### Reputation Levels

| Level | Reputation Range | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Hated** | -10000 to -6000 | Hostile on sight, attacked by faction NPCs |
| **Hostile** | -5999 to -3000 | Aggressive stance, very limited services |
| **Unfriendly** | -2999 to -1000 | Cold reception, basic services only |
| **Neutral** | -999 to 999 | Standard interactions, normal prices |
| **Friendly** | 1000 to 2999 | Welcoming, 5% discount on goods and services |
| **Honored** | 3000 to 5999 | Respected member, 10% discount, special items |
| **Revered** | 6000 to 9999 | Highly esteemed, 15% discount, rare items, faction abilities |
| **Exalted** | 10000+ | Champion status, 20% discount, unique rewards, legendary items |

#### Reputation Gain Sources

**Quest Completion**
- Standard quests: 10-50 reputation
- Daily quests: 75-100 reputation
- Elite quests: 150-250 reputation
- Raid quests: 500-1000 reputation

**Resource Donations**
- Resource turn-ins: 5-25 reputation
- Rare material donations: 50-100 reputation
- Crafted item donations: Varies by quality

**Event Participation**

- World events: 300-1000 reputation

**Achievement Completion**
- Faction-specific achievements: 250-500 reputation
- Legendary achievements: 1000+ reputation

#### Reputation Spread Mechanics

Actions that affect one faction also impact related factions based on their relationships:

**Allied Factions (30% positive spread)**
- Gaining reputation with one faction provides 30% of that gain to allied factions
- Example: +1000 with Faction A → +300 with allied Faction B

**Hostile Factions (30% negative spread)**
- Gaining reputation with one faction reduces reputation with enemy factions
- Example: +1000 with Faction A → -300 with enemy Faction C

**Neutral Factions (No spread)**
- Neutral factions are unaffected by reputation changes elsewhere

This system creates meaningful choices where players cannot simultaneously be friends with all factions and must
strategically choose their alliances.
