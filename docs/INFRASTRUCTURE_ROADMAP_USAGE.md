# BlueMarble Infrastructure & Research Roadmap Usage

This document explains how to use the BlueMarble Infrastructure & Research Roadmap parent issue for project management and traceability.

## Purpose

The Infrastructure & Research Roadmap serves as a **parent issue** that:

- Tracks progress across all 12 major infrastructure research areas
- Links related sub-issues for traceability and project management
- Provides a central coordination point for infrastructure work
- Enables milestone tracking for the Infrastructure project

## Creating the Parent Issue

### Option 1: Using GitHub Issue Template (Recommended)

1. Go to the GitHub repository's Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Infrastructure Research Roadmap (Parent Issue)"
4. Fill in the template fields:
   - Milestone: `Infrastructure`
   - Project: `Infrastructure`
   - Status: `In Progress` (or appropriate status)
   - Additional context as needed
5. Check the setup tasks checklist
6. Create the issue
7. Copy the content from `templates/infrastructure-research-roadmap-issue.md` into the issue description

### Option 2: Manual Creation

1. Create a new GitHub issue
2. Set title: "BlueMarble Infrastructure & Research Roadmap"
3. Copy content from `templates/infrastructure-research-roadmap-issue.md`
4. Set labels: `infrastructure`, `research`, `epic`, `parent`
5. Set milestone: `Infrastructure`
6. Add to project: `Infrastructure`

## Linking Sub-Issues

### Creating Sub-Issues

For each of the 12 research areas:

1. Use `templates/research-question-sub-issue.md` as template
2. Create GitHub issue with title: `[Research] [Specific Research Area Title]`
3. Set **Parent Issue** field to reference the main roadmap issue number
4. Set priority based on the research area classification:
   - High Priority: Issues 2-6
   - Medium Priority: Issues 7-11  
   - Low Priority: Issue 12

### Research Areas to Create Sub-Issues For

#### High Priority (Critical for Core Functionality)
- **Issue #2**: Homogeneous Region Collapsing for Octree Optimization
- **Issue #3**: Hybrid Compression Strategies for Petabyte-Scale Storage  
- **Issue #4**: Multi-Layer Query Optimization for Read-Dominant Workloads
- **Issue #5**: Database Architecture for Petabyte-Scale 3D Octree Storage
- **Issue #6**: 3D Octree Storage Architecture Integration

#### Medium Priority (Performance and Feature Enhancements)  
- **Issue #7**: Delta Overlay System for Fine-Grained Octree Updates
- **Issue #8**: Octree + Grid Hybrid Architecture for Multi-Scale Storage
- **Issue #9**: Octree + Vector Boundary Integration for Precise Features
- **Issue #10**: Grid + Vector Combination for Dense Simulation Areas
- **Issue #11**: Multi-Resolution Blending for Scale-Dependent Geological Processes

#### Low Priority (Future Scalability)
- **Issue #12**: Distributed Octree Architecture with Spatial Hash Distribution

### Updating Parent Issue References

As you create sub-issues:

1. Update the parent issue checkboxes with actual issue numbers
2. Replace `#[Issue-X]` placeholders with real issue numbers (e.g., `#[Issue-2]` → `#42`)
3. Ensure each sub-issue references the parent issue number
4. Use GitHub's linking syntax to create automatic relationships

## Project Management Integration

### Milestones
- Set milestone: **Infrastructure** for both parent and sub-issues
- Track progress through milestone completion percentage

### Projects  
- Add issues to **Infrastructure** project board
- Use project board columns to track status: Planning → In Progress → Review → Done

### Labels
- Parent issue: `infrastructure`, `research`, `epic`, `parent`
- Sub-issues: `research`, `infrastructure`, plus specific area labels (e.g., `database`, `optimization`, `compression`)

### Dependencies
- Track critical path dependencies in the parent issue
- Use GitHub's "blocked by" / "blocks" relationships for sub-issues
- Update dependency status as work progresses

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Updates
- Brief status updates in parent issue comments
- Link to detailed progress in sub-issues
- Identify blockers and resource needs

### Completion Tracking
- Use checkbox completion in parent issue for quick overview
- Update implementation phase status as work progresses
- Mark research areas as completed with ✅ checkmark

### Communication
- Tag relevant team members in progress updates
- Use parent issue for cross-functional coordination
- Reference specific sub-issues for detailed technical discussions

## Success Metrics

Track the following metrics through the parent issue:

### Performance Targets
- Query Response Time: < 100ms for interactive zoom levels
- Memory Usage: < 2GB for global dataset processing  
- Storage Efficiency: 50-80% reduction in storage size
- Update Performance: 10x improvement for sparse geological updates

### Quality Metrics  
- Scientific Accuracy: Maintain geological realism
- Data Consistency: No data loss during migration
- System Compatibility: Maintain functional compatibility during transition
- Scalability: Support 10x larger datasets without linear performance degradation

## Example Workflow

1. **Create Parent Issue** using GitHub template or manual process
2. **Set Up Project Structure** with milestones, labels, and project board
3. **Create High-Priority Sub-Issues** (Issues 2-6) first
4. **Link Sub-Issues** to parent with proper references
5. **Begin Foundation Phase** with Database Architecture (#5)
6. **Track Progress** through weekly updates and checkbox completion
7. **Create Additional Sub-Issues** as team capacity allows
8. **Maintain Dependencies** and update blocking relationships
9. **Complete Research Areas** and update parent issue status
10. **Final Documentation** and project completion tracking

This workflow ensures proper traceability, project management integration, and coordination across all infrastructure research activities.
