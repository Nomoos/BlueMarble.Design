# Contributing to BlueMarble.Design

Welcome to the BlueMarble.Design repository! This guide will help you contribute effectively to our design documentation and research efforts.

## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself** with the repository structure and existing documentation
2. **Choose a category** that aligns with your contribution (gameplay, world, systems, ui-ux, audio, research)
3. **Use the appropriate template** from the `templates/` directory
4. **Follow naming conventions** and maintain consistency with existing documents

## Document Guidelines

### File Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens: `player-progression-system.md`
- Include version numbers for major revisions: `combat-mechanics-v2.md`
- Use appropriate prefixes for document types:
  - `gdd-` for Game Design Documents
  - `tdd-` for Technical Design Documents
  - `spec-` for Feature Specifications
  - `research-` for Research Reports

### Document Structure

All documents should include:

1. **Header section** with title, version, author, and date
2. **Executive summary** or overview
3. **Detailed content** organized with clear headings
4. **References and dependencies** to other documents
5. **Revision history** for tracking changes

### Writing Style

- Write clearly and concisely
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for readability
- Include diagrams, mockups, or visual aids when helpful
- Define technical terms and acronyms
- Maintain consistency with established terminology

## Review Process

1. **Create a pull request** with your new or updated documentation
2. **Assign reviewers** from relevant teams (design, development, product)
3. **Address feedback** and iterate on the document
4. **Obtain approval** from designated stakeholders
5. **Merge** after all requirements are met
