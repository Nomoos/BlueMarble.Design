## Title
Phase 2 Planning: Organize Discovered Sources from Phase 1 Research

## Labels
- `research`
- `phase-2`
- `planning`
- `source-discovery`

## Description

This issue tracks the planning and organization of newly discovered research sources from Phase 1 execution. After all 20 Phase 1 assignment groups complete, this issue manages the collection, prioritization, and redistribution of discovered sources into new Phase 2 assignment groups.

### Prerequisites

- ✅ All Phase 1 groups complete (Issue #{{PARENT_ISSUE_PHASE1}})
- ✅ All discovered sources logged in assignment group files
- ✅ Master research queue updated with Phase 1 completions

### Phase 2 Planning Process

#### Step 1: Discovery Collection (Day 1)

Collect all discovered sources from 20 Phase 1 assignment groups:

- [ ] Review "New Sources Discovery" sections in groups 01-20
- [ ] Compile master list of all discoveries
- [ ] Count total discovered sources
- [ ] Initial category breakdown

**Template Location:** `/research/literature/research-assignment-template-phase-2.md`

#### Step 2: Validation and Prioritization (Day 2-3)

Validate and prioritize all discovered sources:

- [ ] Review each source for relevance
- [ ] Validate priority assessments
- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Add missing information (effort estimates, categories)
- [ ] Confirm BlueMarble applicability

#### Step 3: Statistical Analysis (Day 3)

Create discovery statistics:

- [ ] Count by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Count by category (GameDev-Tech/Design/Content/Survival)
- [ ] Calculate total effort required
- [ ] Determine optimal number of Phase 2 groups

**Expected:** Similar to Phase 1 pattern where "Game Programming in C++" discovered 5 new sources

#### Step 4: Balance and Distribution (Day 4)

Create balanced Phase 2 assignment groups:

- [ ] Sort sources by priority
- [ ] Calculate target effort per group
- [ ] Use round-robin distribution algorithm
- [ ] Aim for similar structure: up to 20 groups if needed
- [ ] Balance priority mix across groups

**Balancing Algorithm:**
1. Sort by priority: Critical → High → Medium → Low
2. Calculate: Total effort / Number of groups
3. Distribute Critical sources evenly first
4. Fill with High, Medium, Low to balance effort
5. Target: ±5 hours variance between groups

#### Step 5: Create Phase 2 Assignment Files (Day 5)

Generate new assignment group files:

- [ ] Create `research-assignment-phase-2-group-01.md` through `group-XX.md`
- [ ] Use Phase 2 template structure
- [ ] Include all metadata and deliverables
- [ ] Add discovery tracking sections
- [ ] Update overview document

#### Step 6: Update Master Queue (Day 5)

Update master research queue:

- [ ] Add all Phase 2 sources to queue
- [ ] Mark as "Phase 2 - Pending"
- [ ] Update total source count
- [ ] Recalculate completion percentages
- [ ] Note source of discoveries

#### Step 7: Create Phase 2 Sub-Issues (Day 6)

Create tracking issues for Phase 2:

- [ ] Create parent issue for Phase 2
- [ ] Create sub-issues for each Phase 2 group
- [ ] Link to Phase 1 parent issue
- [ ] Set up progress tracking

### Discovery Statistics Template

```markdown
## Phase 1 Discovery Summary

**Research Period:** {{START_DATE}} - {{END_DATE}}
**Groups Analyzed:** 20
**Primary Topics Completed:** {{COMPLETED_COUNT}}
**New Sources Discovered:** {{DISCOVERY_COUNT}}

### Priority Distribution

| Priority | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | {{CRITICAL}} | {{PERCENT}}% |
| High | {{HIGH}} | {{PERCENT}}% |
| Medium | {{MEDIUM}} | {{PERCENT}}% |
| Low | {{LOW}} | {{PERCENT}}% |
| **Total** | {{TOTAL}} | 100% |

### Category Distribution

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| GameDev-Tech | {{COUNT}} |
| GameDev-Design | {{COUNT}} |
| GameDev-Content | {{COUNT}} |
| Survival | {{COUNT}} |
| Other | {{COUNT}} |
```

### Expected Outcomes

Based on historical patterns:

- **Estimated Discoveries:** 20-40 new sources (avg 1-2 per group)
- **High Priority Expected:** 40-50% of discoveries
- **Phase 2 Groups:** 10-20 groups depending on discoveries
- **Phase 2 Timeline:** Similar 1-2 week execution

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All discoveries collected and documented
- [ ] Priorities validated and consistent
- [ ] Phase 2 groups created and balanced
- [ ] Master queue updated
- [ ] Phase 2 issues created
- [ ] Team ready to begin Phase 2 execution

**Status:** Blocked (waiting for Phase 1 completion)  
**Phase:** Planning for Phase 2  
**Start After:** All Phase 1 groups complete  
**Duration:** ~1 week planning
