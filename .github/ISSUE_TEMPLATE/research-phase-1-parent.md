### Phase 1 Execution Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Day 1-2: Complete Critical priority groups (1-2, 21-24)
- Day 1-7: Start all High priority groups (3-9, 25-35)
- Day 3-7: Start Medium priority groups (10-15, 36-40)

**Week 2:**
- Complete remaining High and Medium priority groups
- Complete Low priority groups (16-19)
- Activate Group 20 if critical discoveries are made
- Begin Phase 2 planning

### Success Metrics

- ✅ All 20 groups assigned to team members
- ✅ Critical items complete within 3 days
- ✅ 50% High priority complete within Week 1
- ✅ 80% total completion within Week 2
- ✅ All documents meet quality standards
- ✅ Discovered sources logged for Phase 2
- ✅ Zero merge conflicts

### Quality Requirements

All deliverables must meet:
- Proper YAML front matter
- Minimum length requirements
- Code examples where relevant
- Cross-references to related research
- Clear BlueMarble-specific recommendations

### Discovery Tracking

Each group logs newly discovered sources in their assignment file. After Phase 1:
1. Collect all discoveries from 20 groups
2. Prioritize and validate
3. Create Phase 2 assignment groups (tracked in #{{ISSUE_PHASE2}})
