## Algorithm Details

### Viral Score Formula

```
Viral Score (0-100) = 
    Engagement Score × 40% +
    Social Score × 30% +
    Quality Score × 20% +
    Recency Score × 10%
```

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. Engagement Score (40% weight)
Measures how players interact with content:
- **Shares**: 10× multiplier (most valuable)
- **Saves**: 5× multiplier
- **Comments**: 3× multiplier
- **Reactions**: 2× multiplier
- **Views**: 1× multiplier (base)

**Bonuses:**
- Completion rate: up to +50%
- Time spent: up to 2× for longer engagement

#### 2. Social Score (30% weight)
Measures network reach:
- Cross-guild shares: 15× multiplier (KEY viral indicator)
- Alliance reach: log scale
- Guild size: log scale
- Author followers: log scale
- Author reputation: linear

#### 3. Quality Score (20% weight)
Assesses content quality:
- Uniqueness: 30 points
- Emotional impact: 30 points
- Narrative quality: 30 points
- Word count bonuses: 3-7 points
- Media bonuses: images (+2), video (+3)

#### 4. Recency Score (10% weight)
Temporal decay:
- Half-life: 3 days
- Exponential decay function
- Recent content boosted

## Usage Examples

### Basic Ranking

```python
from scripts.story_viral_ranking import StoryRanker
import time

ranker = StoryRanker()
ranked = ranker.rank_stories(stories, time.time())

for story in ranked:
    print(f"#{story.viral_rank}: {story.title}")
    print(f"  Score: {story.viral_score:.2f}")
```

### Get Top Stories

```python
top_10 = ranker.get_top_stories(stories, time.time(), top_n=10)
```

### Get Trending (Last 24 Hours)

```python
trending = ranker.get_trending_stories(
    stories, time.time(), 
    recency_hours=24, top_n=10
)
```

### Filter by Type

```python
discovery = ranker.get_stories_by_type(
    stories, time.time(), 
    StoryType.DISCOVERY_STORY, top_n=10
)
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Social Feed
Display trending stories in player feeds based on viral score

### 2. Discovery UI
"Popular Stories" section showing top-ranked content

### 3. Guild Content Feeds
Top stories from guild members

### 4. Notifications
Alert authors when their content goes viral (score ≥ 70)

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
Track viral scores, trending patterns, content type performance

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Cache rankings for 5 minutes (recommended)
- Invalidate on new content or significant metric changes

### Database Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_created_timestamp ON stories(created_timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_type ON stories(story_type, created_timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_trending ON stories(created_timestamp DESC, views DESC, shares DESC);
```

### Query Optimization
- Pre-calculate viral scores periodically
- Store in separate ranking table
- Update on schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes)
