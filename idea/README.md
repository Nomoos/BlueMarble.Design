# Idea

This directory contains idea files for the StoryGenerator pipeline.

## Purpose

The idea stage is the starting point of the video generation pipeline. This is where initial concepts, themes, and story ideas are stored before being processed into scripts.

## Structure

Ideas should be stored as markdown files with the following naming convention:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-idea-name.md` for dated ideas
- `idea-name.md` for general ideas

## Usage

1. Create a new markdown file with your idea
2. Include key concepts, themes, and any initial thoughts
3. Ideas from this folder will be processed by the pipeline into the script stage
