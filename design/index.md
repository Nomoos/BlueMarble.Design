## Contributing

When adding design documents:

1. Keep documents focused on a single aspect
2. Target 200-400 lines per document
3. Use kebab-case filenames
4. Include front matter with metadata
5. Cross-link related documents
6. Update this index

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
