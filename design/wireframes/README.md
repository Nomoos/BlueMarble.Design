# Design Wireframes

This directory contains wireframes, mockups, and interface design documentation for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Store UI/UX wireframes and screen layouts
- Document user interface flow and navigation
- Maintain mockups for different game screens and features

## Files

- [UI Wireframes](ui-wireframes.md) - General UI wireframes and interface mockups
- [Example Screen](example-screen.md) - Example wireframe demonstrating format

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `screen-name-wireframe.md` (e.g., `inventory-screen-wireframe.md`)
- Keep files focused on one screen or feature
- Include visual descriptions or link to assets
- Document user interactions and flow

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `login-screen-wireframe.md` not `screen.md`
- Include version numbers for iterations: `combat-ui-wireframe-v2.md`

## Asset Integration

- Link to visual assets in `/assets/mockups/`
- Reference related design documents
- Include accessibility considerations
