# Design Directory

This directory contains game design documentation for BlueMarble, focusing on iterative design development and vision documentation for the medieval MMO simulation game.

## Purpose

The `/design` folder serves as the central location for:

- **Game Design Documents**: Core design vision and mechanics documentation
- **Iterative Design Process**: Version-controlled design evolution and refinement
- **Design Vision Storage**: Foundational design concepts and direction
- **Design Specifications**: Detailed game mechanics and systems design

## Folder Structure

```
design/
├── README.md                    # This file - explains folder purpose and workflow
├── island_start_game_design.md  # Core game design document for island start scope
└── [future-design-docs].md     # Additional design documents as development progresses
```

## Document Types

### Game Design Documents
- **File Pattern**: `[scope]_game_design.md`
- **Purpose**: Core design vision, mechanics, and technical implementation notes
- **Content**: One-page design format with gameplay loops, mechanics, technical architecture

### Design Specifications
- **File Pattern**: `spec-[feature-name].md`
- **Purpose**: Detailed feature specifications and implementation guidance
- **Content**: Specific feature requirements, user flows, and technical considerations

## Workflow and Update Process

### Adding New Design Documents
1. **Research Phase**: Review existing documentation and gather requirements
2. **Draft Creation**: Create initial design document using established format
3. **Review Process**: Collaborate with stakeholders for feedback and iteration
4. **Version Control**: Use Git commits to track design evolution and decisions
5. **Integration**: Link to related documents in `/docs`, `/templates`, and `/assets`

### Design Document Format
All design documents should include:
- **Header**: Title, version, author, date, status
- **Executive Summary**: Core concept and vision
- **Detailed Design**: Mechanics, systems, and implementation notes
- **Technical Considerations**: Architecture suggestions and constraints
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved design decisions requiring input

### Versioning Strategy
- Use Git commit history for tracking design iterations
- Include meaningful commit messages describing design changes
- Tag major design milestones for easy reference
- Maintain revision history within documents for significant changes

## Integration with Project Structure

### Relationship to Other Directories
- **`/docs`**: Technical implementation details and system specifications
- **`/templates`**: Document templates and formatting standards
- **`/assets`**: Visual design assets, mockups, and reference materials
- **`/roadmap`**: Project timeline and feature prioritization

### Cross-References
Design documents should reference:
- Related technical specifications in `/docs`
- Implementation templates from `/templates`
- Visual assets and mockups in `/assets`
- Timeline and priorities from `/roadmap`

## Quality Standards

### Content Requirements
- Clear, concise language appropriate for development teams
- Well-structured sections with logical flow
- Visual aids (diagrams, mockups) when helpful
- Technical accuracy and feasibility considerations

### Documentation Standards
- Follow project markdown formatting conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns and file organization
- Include proper internal linking to related documents
- Maintain up-to-date revision information

## Getting Started

### For Design Contributors
1. Review existing design documents in this folder
2. Check related documentation in `/docs` for technical context
3. Use appropriate templates from `/templates` directory
4. Follow established naming conventions and format patterns
5. Coordinate with development teams for technical feasibility

### For Developers
1. Reference design documents for feature implementation guidance
2. Provide feedback on design feasibility during review process
3. Update design documents when implementation deviates from initial design
4. Use design specifications to guide development priorities
