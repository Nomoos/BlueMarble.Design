# Design Architecture

This directory contains system architecture diagrams and technical design documentation for the BlueMarble project.

## Purpose

- Document system modules and their interactions
- Store architecture diagrams and technical specifications
- Maintain design patterns and architectural decisions

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `module-name-architecture.md` (e.g., `database-architecture.md`)
- Keep files focused on one system or module
- Include diagrams using Mermaid or link to assets
- Document design rationale and trade-offs

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens
- Be specific: `authentication-module-architecture.md` not `module.md`
- Include version numbers for major revisions: `api-architecture-v2.md`

## Diagram Guidelines

- Use Mermaid for inline diagrams when possible
- Link to complex diagrams in `/assets/diagrams/`
- Document component interactions and data flow
- Include scalability and performance considerations
