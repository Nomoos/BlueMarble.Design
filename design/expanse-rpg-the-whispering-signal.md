# The Whispering Signal

**System:** The Expanse RPG (Modern AGE)  
**Type:** Research / Investigation → Exploration (optional)  
**Estimated Length:** 1–2 sessions  
**Tone:** Tense, conspiratorial, hard-sci-fi

---

## Summary

A Belter salvage crew intercepts a fragmented, low-power signal while drifting between **Ceres** and **Tycho Station**. The looped burst doesn't match known comm protocols. Rumors call it a distress beacon—or bait.

This scenario showcases a **research-driven** investigation where players follow multiple investigative paths (technical analysis, social networking, field exploration) to uncover the truth behind a mysterious signal. The tension builds through a "Churn" mechanic that introduces complications as players make progress, creating a race against rival factions.

**Central Question:** What is the true nature of the signal, and who (or what) is behind it?

---

## Player-Facing Hook

Your ship's passive array catches a ghost transmission on a decaying orbit near a debris field. The packet repeats every 17 minutes, with irregular phase noise. The ID header's corrupted—but there's a Belter proverb buried in the checksum.

- [ ] Offer a small Finder's Fee from a Tycho fixer if the crew shares the signal.
- [ ] A rival crew "accidentally" hails you asking about the same ping.

---

## Background (GM Only)

The burst originated from an **abandoned UN research skiff** that suffered a catastrophic power fault during a black-box trial. Its encrypted core stores sensitive nav telemetry and prototype diagnostics. Multiple factions want it silenced or salvaged first.

The skiff was conducting secret weapons tests in a remote sector when a power system failure caused the crew to evacuate. The onboard AI, before shutting down, injected a Belter proverb into the distress signal as a warning from a sympathetic engineer who knew the project was ethically questionable.

Now, three factions are racing to recover it:
- **UN R&D** wants to secure or destroy the evidence
- **Martian Intelligence** wants the prototype data
- **OPA cell** wants to expose the illegal testing

---

## Research Avenues / Investigation Paths

### Technical Analysis

- **Focuses:** Intelligence (Technology, Science)
- **Tests:** Reconstruct the data stream, deconvolve phase noise, map packet cadence
- **Breakthroughs:** Ephemeris fit (rough origin), partial decryption (UN header), checksum proverb (Belter author injected it)

**Sample TNs:**
- TN 11: Identify the 17-minute loop pattern
- TN 13: Decrypt UN header fragment
- TN 15: Discover the Belter proverb in checksum

### Cultural / Political Knowledge

- **Focuses:** Communication (Current Affairs), Intelligence (Cryptography), Perception (Seeing Through Lies)
- **Tests:** Identify slang, encryption family, ownership claims
- **Breakthroughs:** UN R&D shell company match; Tycho rumor about "quiet skiff"; Martian interest spike in the sector last week

**Sample TNs:**
- TN 11: Recognize encryption as UN military-grade
- TN 13: Connect to shell company rumors
- TN 15: Identify recent Martian patrol pattern changes

### Social Investigation

- **Focuses:** Communication (Persuasion, Investigation)
- **Tests:** Tycho docks scuttlebutt, Ceres black-market chatter, union dispatch logs
- **Breakthroughs:** A broker knows a pilot who ferried a sealed crate from the same vector; rival crew has a "salvage warrant"

**Sample TNs:**
- TN 11: Get basic dock gossip
- TN 13: Find broker with useful information
- TN 15: Discover rival crew's "warrant" is fake

### Field Research (On-Site)

- **Focuses:** Dexterity (Pilot), Accuracy (Navigation), Perception (Searching)
- **Tests:** Track origin through debris, avoid micro-meteoroids, locate thermal ghost
- **Breakthroughs:** Find the skiff in a slow tumble; radiators cold; weak internal ping persists

**Sample TNs:**
- TN 11: Navigate debris field safely
- TN 13: Locate thermal signature
- TN 15: Identify safe boarding approach

> **GM Guidance:** Set TNs appropriate to your table. Each solid success yields one **Clue**; stunts or exceptional success can yield extra.

## Clues & Breakthroughs

| # | Clue | Source | Effect |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Packet cadence = 17:00 loop | Technical | Confirms intentional broadcast |
| 2 | UN checksum header fragment | Technical | Identifies origin as UN asset |
| 3 | Belter proverb in checksum | Technical/Cultural | Suggests insider tampering |
| 4 | Broker tip about sealed crate | Social | Confirms recent local activity |
| 5 | Rival "salvage warrant" | Social | Introduces timed competition |
| 6 | Skiff's thermal ghost | Field | Pins precise location |
| 7 | Martian patrol chatter spike | Cultural | Raises stakes / jurisdiction |
| 8 | Core tamper alerts (old) | Field | Someone tried to erase data |

---

## Complications & Pressure (GM Tools)

### The Churn

Track rising tension and faction awareness:

- **+1** when the crew publicly asks about the signal
- **+1** when they crack a major packet (Clue 2 or 3)
- **+1** when they commit a crime (illegal scan, bribery, trespass)

**Trigger Events:**
- **Churn 10:** Rival crew shadows them; tense hail
- **Churn 20:** **Martian patrol** sweeps the sector; demands transponder handshake
- **Churn 30:** A third-party interceptor arrives (corporate black-ops or OPA cell)

### Conditions

- **Fatigued:** Long decryption Interludes without proper rest
- **Hindered (Ship Systems):** Jury-rigged power routing to boost sensor gain
- **Wounded:** EVA mishap during skiff boarding

### Time Pressure

The signal is decaying. After discovering the source, players have approximately 12-24 hours before:
- The skiff's power completely fails, erasing the core
- A major faction arrives with superior resources
- The debris field shifts, making approach more dangerous

---

## Interludes (Between Scenes)

Players can take downtime between major investigative pushes:

- **Recover:** Clear Fatigued by proper downtime (full rest, good food, relaxation)
- **Maintenance:** Improve sensor arrays; remove Hindered condition
- **Relationships/Networking:** Create a one-use Contact on Tycho/Ceres for advantage on a Social test
- **Project:** Build a custom deconvolution filter granting +2 on the next Technical Analysis test

---

## Set Piece Scenes (Optional)

### Spaceship Scene: Pursuit or Interception

If pursued or intercepted, run a **space encounter** with sensor shadowing, thrust-vector bluffing, or a non-lethal railgun warning.

**Setup:** Another ship detects the crew's interest in the signal  
**Challenges:** 
- Out-maneuver pursuit without damaging ship
- Avoid escalating to lethal combat
- Maintain operational security

**Options:**
- **Lightning Attack (comms jamming ping):** Stunt to disrupt enemy communications
- **Taunt (radio banter):** Social maneuvering to confuse or delay
- **Defensive Stance (evasive burn):** Pilot maneuvers to avoid detection

**Outcomes:**
- **Success:** Shake pursuit, maintain secrecy
- **Partial:** Escape but reveal destination or capabilities
- **Failure:** Forced negotiation or confrontation at the skiff

---

## Outcomes

### Truth Uncovered (Full Success)

The skiff is a UN R&D platform; core contains prototype diagnostics and nav telemetry implicating a quiet test range. Crew secures the core and extracts cleanly (or trades it to a faction).

**Resolution:** Players recover the data intact and can choose which faction to support, expose the information publicly, or keep it for leverage.

**Rewards:**
- Major payday (5,000-10,000 credits if sold) or political leverage
- **Fortune refresh**
- New **Contact** (faction representative) or **Reputation** boost
- Potential story hook: UN wants revenge, or faction owes them a favor

### Partial Success

Crew locates the skiff but extraction is contested; the core is fragmented—yields a **map fragment** or partial logs.

**Resolution:** Players get some information but not everything, and had to compromise or fight for it.

**Consequences:**
- Partial payment (2,000-3,000 credits)
- A faction marks the crew for future "attention"
- Future complication clocks tick faster when dealing with this faction
- Incomplete data raises more questions than it answers

### Failure / Misinterpretation

Rival springs an ambush; patrol seizes the ship; or the signal was laced with a honeypot leading to legal/ethical heat.

**Resolution:** The crew's interference made things worse or they got outmaneuvered.

**Consequences:**
- Temporary gear loss (impounded equipment)
- Legal fines or detention
- Obligation to a fixer who bails them out
- Rival crew gets the prize and may gloat/threaten later

## Reusability Notes

### How to Adapt This Scenario

This scenario framework can be re-used with different content by swapping out the central mystery, the factions, and the locations.

**File the serial numbers off:**

- **Signal → Artifact:** Instead of a signal, make it a physical object (ancient artifact, lost cargo, escaped experimental subject)
- **Skiff → Lab:** Change the source from a derelict ship to an abandoned station, hidden lab, or crashed shuttle
- **Factions → Locals:** Replace UN/Mars/OPA with setting-appropriate factions (corporate rivals, criminal organizations, local governments)

**Scaling:**

- **For fewer players:** Reduce number of investigation paths to 2-3 instead of 4, or give them more helpful NPCs
- **For more players:** Add competing timelines (multiple signals to investigate), increase opposition difficulty
- **For different power levels:** Adjust TNs and opposition stats; add or remove complications from The Churn

### Re-Use This Template

Copy this structure and replace details to generate new **Research Issues** quickly:

1. Keep the multi-path investigation structure
2. Maintain the pressure/complication mechanic (rename "The Churn" as needed)
3. Provide clear clues with multiple discovery methods
4. Include meaningful choices between factions/outcomes
5. Design for emergent gameplay rather than linear progression

## Design Analysis for BlueMarble

### Lessons Learned

**Pattern 1: Multiple Investigation Paths**
- Players can approach the mystery from technical, social, or exploratory angles
- No single "correct" path; all roads lead to useful information
- Rewards player creativity and different character builds
- **Why it works:** Ensures all players feel useful and engaged regardless of character specialization

**Pattern 2: Tension/Pressure Mechanic ("The Churn")**
- Visible mechanic that tracks rising stakes
- Player actions have consequences beyond immediate success/failure
- Creates urgency without arbitrary time limits
- **Why it works:** Makes the world feel reactive and alive; rewards clever play that avoids detection

**Pattern 3: Partial Information & Mystery**
- Players don't get all answers immediately
- Information gathering is rewarding and progressive
- Multiple small clues build to bigger picture
- **Why it works:** Maintains engagement and sense of discovery throughout scenario

### Digital Adaptation Ideas

**Translatable Elements:**

1. **Multi-Path Investigations**
   - Could work as quest system with Technical/Social/Exploration branches
   - Each path yields different clues via different gameplay (hacking minigame, dialogue trees, exploration)
   - Players choose approach based on character build and preference

2. **Tension Mechanic**
   - "Heat" or "Alert Level" system that rises based on player actions
   - Triggers scripted events at thresholds (rival NPCs appear, patrol increases, etc.)
   - Visual feedback (UI element, changing world state) keeps players informed

3. **Clue Assembly**
   - Evidence/clue collection system where players piece together information
   - Investigation journal that updates with discovered information
   - Multiple sources for same clue reduces frustration from missing content

**Challenges:**

1. **Emergent Social Interactions**
   - Hard to replicate GM flexibility in NPC responses
   - Would need robust dialogue system or AI to handle creative approaches
   - May need to design for more limited NPC interaction options

2. **Pacing Control**
   - Tabletop GM can adjust difficulty and pacing on the fly
   - Digital version needs alternative methods (difficulty scaling, optional hints, save states)
   - Risk of players getting stuck without GM intervention

**Opportunities:**

1. **Persistent World Consequences**
   - Player choices can affect faction reputation permanently
   - Other players might encounter consequences of earlier players' actions
   - Creates sense of living world and meaningful choice

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Signal analysis could be actual interactive minigame (not just dice rolls)
   - Space navigation and debris field could be visually spectacular
   - EVA boarding could be tense first-person or third-person sequence

3. **Asynchronous Investigation**
   - Different players could pursue different paths simultaneously
   - Social players gather intel while technical players decode signals
   - Results combine for group benefit

### Player Engagement Techniques

**Technique 1: Hook with Mystery, Not Mission**
- Instead of "go recover the thing," present a puzzle: "What is this signal?"
- Players are naturally curious and will pursue answers
- Works because it engages problem-solving drive, not just task completion

**Technique 2: Branching Information Sources**
- No single NPC or location has all answers
- Encourages exploration and interaction with world
- Rewards thorough investigation without punishing efficiency

**Technique 3: Visible Consequences**
- The Churn mechanic makes player actions matter
- Players can see how their choices affect the world
- Creates tension without arbitrary fail states

**Technique 4: Faction Play**
- Multiple interested parties create complex political landscape
- Players must choose sides or play factions against each other
- No obviously "right" choice; all have trade-offs

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Quick Reference - Target Numbers

| Task Complexity | TN | Example |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| Routine | 9 | Basic signal detection |
| Average | 11 | Identify loop pattern |
| Challenging | 13 | Decrypt UN header |
| Hard | 15 | Find hidden proverb |
| Formidable | 17 | Extract full nav data |

### Appendix B: Extended Background - The Black-Ops Program

The UN Defense Research Division has been conducting unauthorized weapons tests in the Belt for 18 months. The program, codenamed "Whisper Protocol," develops ECM systems that can spoof civilian transponders. The engineer who embedded the Belter proverb was Sofia Mbatha, a Belt-born specialist who grew increasingly uncomfortable with the project's implications. Her warning led to this entire situation.

### Appendix C: Alternative Hooks

1. **Salvage Contract:** Players are hired by a corporation to investigate the signal as part of standard salvage work
2. **Personal Connection:** One PC knows Sofia Mbatha and recognizes the proverb as her favorite saying
3. **Ambush Opening:** Scenario starts in media res with rival crew already confronting the PCs about the signal
4. **Distress Call:** The signal initially appears to be a standard distress beacon, only revealing its complexity upon closer examination
