# Script

This directory contains script files generated from ideas in the StoryGenerator pipeline.

## Purpose

The script stage transforms ideas into structured narratives with dialogue, scene descriptions, and timing information.

## Structure

Scripts should be stored as markdown or text files with the following naming convention:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-script-name.md` for dated scripts
- `script-name.md` for general scripts

## Usage

1. Scripts are generated from ideas in the `/idea` directory
2. Each script should include:
   - Scene descriptions
   - Dialogue
   - Timing information
   - Transitions
3. Scripts from this folder will be processed into storyboards in the next stage
