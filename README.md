# BlueMarble.Design

BlueMarble.Design is the research and design hub for BlueMarble, a top-down MMORPG. This repository gathers issues, documents, and research from across the BlueMarble ecosystem to generate structured design outputs. By combining exploration, documentation, and system concepts, it provides a solid foundation for features, mechanics, and world-building that will guide downstream development.

## Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for all design-related activities in the BlueMarble ecosystem, including:

- **Research & Exploration**: Market analysis, player behavior studies, and technical research
- **Design Documentation**: Comprehensive design documents covering all aspects of the game
- **System Concepts**: Core mechanics, progression systems, and gameplay loops
- **World Building**: Lore, narrative, and environmental design
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed specifications that guide development teams
