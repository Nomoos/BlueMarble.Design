# BlueMarble.Design

BlueMarble.Design is the research and design repository for BlueMarble, a top-down MMORPG. It collects research, concepts, and structured design docs—covering gameplay, world, systems, UI/UX, and audio—that guide and inform development across other BlueMarble repositories.

## Quick Start

### Core Documentation
- **[Game Design Document](./docs/core/game-design-document.md)** - Complete game vision and design
- **[Technical Design Document](./docs/core/technical-design-document.md)** - Technical architecture and requirements
- **[Documentation Index](./docs/README.md)** - Complete documentation structure

### Key Systems
- **[Gameplay Systems](./docs/systems/gameplay-systems.md)** - Combat, progression, and core mechanics
- **[UI/UX Guidelines](./docs/ui-ux/ui-guidelines.md)** - Interface design and user experience standards

## Project Vision

BlueMarble is designed as a community-driven MMORPG that combines classic MMO elements with modern design principles. Our design philosophy emphasizes:

- **Meaningful Player Choice** - Decisions that impact gameplay and story
- **Community Building** - Systems that foster lasting player relationships  
- **Accessibility** - Inclusive design for players of all abilities
- **Scalable Design** - Architecture that can grow with the player base

## Contributing

This repository serves as the design foundation for BlueMarble development. All design decisions should be documented here before implementation in other repositories.

### Design Process
1. **Research** - Gather requirements and analyze solutions
2. **Document** - Create detailed design specifications
3. **Review** - Collaborate with team on design decisions
4. **Iterate** - Refine based on feedback and testing
5. **Implement** - Guide development teams in other repositories

For detailed contribution guidelines, see the [Documentation Standards](./docs/README.md#documentation-standards) section.
