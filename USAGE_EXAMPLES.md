# BlueMarble.Design Usage Examples

This document demonstrates how to effectively use the BlueMarble.Design repository structure with practical examples.

## Scenario 1: Adding a New Gameplay Feature

### Step 1: Research Phase
1. Check existing documentation in `/docs/research/` for relevant studies
2. If needed, create new research document using `/templates/research-report.md`
3. Example: `docs/research/research-player-crafting-preferences.md`

### Step 2: Design Phase
1. Create feature specification using `/templates/feature-specification.md`
2. Place in appropriate category: `docs/gameplay/spec-crafting-system.md`
3. Link to related research and dependencies

### Step 3: Review and Integration
1. Update roadmap in `/roadmap/project-roadmap.md`
2. Cross-reference with related systems in other documentation categories
3. Add to appropriate tracking systems

## Scenario 2: World Building Development

### Step 1: Foundation
1. Review existing world documentation in `/docs/world/`
2. Create new lore document: `docs/world/lore-northern-kingdoms.md`
3. Use narrative design guidelines from category README

### Step 2: Integration
1. Update related gameplay documentation to reflect world elements
2. Consider UI/UX implications for presenting lore to players
3. Document any technical requirements in `/docs/systems/`

### Step 3: Asset Planning
1. Create asset requirements in `/assets/` directory
2. Link visual design needs to UI/UX documentation
3. Plan audio requirements in `/docs/audio/`

## Scenario 3: Technical System Design

### Step 1: Research Requirements
1. Review gameplay and world requirements that drive technical needs
2. Research technical approaches in `/docs/research/`
3. Document findings: `docs/research/research-technical-networking-solutions.md`

### Step 2: System Design
1. Create technical design document: `docs/systems/tdd-multiplayer-networking.md`
2. Specify API requirements: `docs/systems/api-player-sync.md`
3. Plan performance testing approach

### Step 3: Implementation Planning
1. Update project roadmap with technical milestones
2. Identify dependencies on other system components
3. Plan integration testing with gameplay systems

## Scenario 4: Cross-Functional Feature Development

### Example: Social Guild System

This feature touches multiple categories and demonstrates the interconnected nature of the documentation system.

#### Gameplay Design (`docs/gameplay/`)
- `spec-guild-system.md` - Core mechanics and player experience
- `balance-guild-progression.md` - Progression and reward balancing

#### World Integration (`docs/world/`)
- `lore-guild-organizations.md` - How guilds fit into world lore
- `narrative-guild-storylines.md` - Guild-specific quest content

#### Technical Implementation (`docs/systems/`)
- `tdd-guild-infrastructure.md` - Server architecture for guild data
- `api-guild-management.md` - API specifications for guild operations

#### User Interface (`docs/ui-ux/`)
- `ui-guild-management-interface.md` - Guild management UI design
- `ux-guild-discovery-flow.md` - Player journey for finding/joining guilds

#### Audio Design (`docs/audio/`)
- `audio-guild-feedback.md` - Audio cues for guild activities
- `music-guild-halls.md` - Music design for guild spaces

#### Supporting Research (`docs/research/`)
- `research-player-guild-behavior.md` - Player research informing design
- `research-competitive-guild-systems.md` - Analysis of existing solutions

## Document Linking and Cross-References

### Internal Linking Patterns
```markdown
<!-- Link to related documents -->
See also: [Player Progression System](../gameplay/spec-player-progression-system.md)

<!-- Link to research that informed this design -->
Based on: [MMORPG Market Analysis 2024](../research/research-market-mmorpg-analysis-2024.md)

<!-- Link to technical requirements -->
Technical requirements: [Guild Infrastructure](../systems/tdd-guild-infrastructure.md)
```

### Dependency Tracking
Each document should clearly identify:
- **Design Dependencies**: Other design documents that must be completed first
- **Technical Dependencies**: Technical systems required for implementation
- **Content Dependencies**: Art, audio, or written content needed

## Version Control Best Practices

### Branching Strategy
- Create feature branches for major document additions: `feature/guild-system-design`
- Use descriptive commit messages: "Add initial guild system specification"
- Tag major milestone completions: `design-phase-1-complete`

### Review Process
1. Create pull request for new documents
2. Assign reviewers from relevant teams
3. Address feedback and iterate
4. Merge after approval from designated stakeholders

### Change Management
- Update revision history in documents for major changes
- Notify stakeholders of significant updates
- Maintain backward compatibility references for deprecated approaches

## Repository Maintenance

### Regular Activities
- **Weekly**: Update project roadmap with current progress
- **Monthly**: Review and update README files for accuracy
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed or deprecated documents
- **As needed**: Update templates based on usage feedback

### Quality Assurance
- Verify all internal links are functional
- Ensure consistent formatting across documents
- Check that all documents follow established naming conventions
- Validate that templates are being used appropriately
