# BlueMarble Infrastructure & Research Roadmap

**Issue Type:** Parent Research Issue  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Milestone:** Infrastructure  
**Project:** Infrastructure  
**Epic:** Spatial Data Storage Architecture

## Overview

This is the parent tracking issue for BlueMarble's core infrastructure research roadmap focusing on petabyte-scale 3D material storage system. Based on comprehensive spatial data storage analysis, we have identified **12 major research areas** that require investigation and implementation for world material storage.

**Research Documentation:** `research/spatial-data-storage/octree-optimization-guide.md`

This issue acts as a parent for all core infrastructure research issues in BlueMarble. It tracks progress across all major storage, architecture, and optimization topics from the research summary.

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Query Response Time**: < 100ms for interactive zoom levels
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB for global dataset processing  
- **Storage Efficiency**: 50-80% reduction in storage size
- **Update Performance**: 10x improvement for sparse geological updates

### Quality Metrics
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Maintain geological realism
- **Data Consistency**: No data loss during migration
- **System Compatibility**: Maintain functional compatibility during transition
- **Scalability**: Support 10x larger datasets without linear performance degradation

## Technical Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
