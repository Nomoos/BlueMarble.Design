# BlueMarble Core Systems Design Roadmap

**Issue Type:** Parent Design Issue  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Planning  
**Milestone:** Core Systems Design  
**Project:** BlueMarble Project Roadmap  
**Epic:** Core Systems Architecture

## Overview

This is the parent tracking issue for BlueMarble's Core Systems Design covering the foundational research
and design for the MMORPG. This roadmap tracks architecture, scalability, reliability, and integration with
gameplay systems. Timeline: Q4 2025.

This issue acts as a parent for all core systems design issues in BlueMarble. It tracks progress across all
major architecture, gameplay systems, and integration topics.

## Design Areas Overview

This issue tracks the overall progress of our core systems design initiatives. Each design area below will
have its own dedicated sub-issue for detailed tracking and implementation.

### High Priority Design Areas (Critical for Core Functionality)

- [ ] **#[Issue-1]** - Game Architecture Specification
- [ ] **#[Issue-2]** - Core Gameplay Mechanics Design
- [ ] **#[Issue-3]** - Player Progression Framework
- [ ] **#[Issue-4]** - Database Schema Design
- [ ] **#[Issue-5]** - API Specifications and Protocols

### Medium Priority Design Areas (Feature Enhancements)

- [ ] **#[Issue-6]** - Combat System Design
- [ ] **#[Issue-7]** - Character Progression System
- [ ] **#[Issue-8]** - Social and Guild Systems
- [ ] **#[Issue-9]** - Economic System Design
- [ ] **#[Issue-10]** - Security Framework Design

### Low Priority Design Areas (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] **#[Issue-12]** - End-game Content Design
- [ ] **#[Issue-13]** - Cross-platform Compatibility Design

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Design (12-16 weeks)
- Game Architecture Specification (#1) - 4-5 weeks
- Database Schema Design (#4) - 3-4 weeks
- API Specifications (#5) - 3-4 weeks
- Player Progression Framework (#3) - 2-3 weeks

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay Design (16-20 weeks)
- Core Gameplay Mechanics (#2) - 5-6 weeks
- Combat System Design (#6) - 4-5 weeks
- Character Progression System (#7) - 4-5 weeks
- Economic System Design (#9) - 3-4 weeks

### Phase 3: Social and Integration Design (14-18 weeks)
- Social and Guild Systems (#8) - 6-8 weeks
- Security Framework Design (#10) - 4-5 weeks
- Integration Testing Design - 4-5 weeks

### Phase 4: Advanced Features Design (12-16 weeks)
- PvP Systems and Balance (#11) - 5-6 weeks
- End-game Content Design (#12) - 4-5 weeks
- Cross-platform Compatibility (#13) - 3-5 weeks

## Success Metrics

### Design Quality Targets
- **Completeness**: All core systems fully specified with edge cases
- **Consistency**: Cross-system integration points clearly defined
- **Feasibility**: Technical validation completed for all designs
- **Stakeholder Approval**: 100% approval from design, engineering, and product teams

### Documentation Targets
- **Coverage**: All systems documented with implementation guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Clear documentation for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Maintainability**: Living documents updated as decisions evolve
- **Traceability**: All design decisions linked to requirements and rationale

### Team Collaboration Metrics
- **Review Participation**: 100% of core team members review critical designs
- **Feedback Incorporation**: All critical feedback addressed within 1 week
- **Cross-functional Alignment**: Weekly sync across Design, Engineering, and Product
- **Timeline Adherence**: Stay within ±10% of planned timeline

## Technical Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Game Architecture (#1) → All other design issues
- Database Schema (#4) → All data-driven systems
- API Specifications (#5) → All client-server interactions
- Player Progression Framework (#3) → Combat (#6) and Character Progression (#7)

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Combat System (#6) and Economic System (#9) can be developed independently
- Social Systems (#8) and Security Framework (#10) can progress in parallel
- PvP Systems (#11) and End-game Content (#12) can be designed concurrently

## Design Progress Tracking

### Completed Design Work
- [ ] No design work completed yet

### In Progress Design
- [ ] Currently in planning phase

### Planned Design Work
- [ ] 13 design areas pending issue creation and assignment

## Next Steps

1. **Create Sub-Issues**: Create individual GitHub issues for each design area using the research question template
2. **Assign Priorities**: Distribute design areas based on team capacity and expertise
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand scope and timeline
4. **Begin Foundation Phase**: Start with high-priority Game Architecture (#1)
