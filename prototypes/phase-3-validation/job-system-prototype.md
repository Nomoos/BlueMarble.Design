## Performance Findings

### CPU Utilization

| Workers | Utilization | Speedup | Efficiency |
|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1       | 100%        | 1.0x    | 100%       |
| 2       | 198%        | 1.98x   | 99%        |
| 4       | 388%        | 3.88x   | 97%        |
| 8       | 660%        | 6.6x    | 82.5%      |
| 16      | 980%        | 9.8x    | 61.3%      |

**Finding:** Diminishing returns after ~8 cores due to synchronization overhead.

### Memory Overhead

- Per-thread stack: 1MB
- Job queue: ~100KB base + 64 bytes per queued job
- Dependency graph: 32 bytes per job
- Total for 1000 active jobs: ~8.5MB

**Finding:** Memory overhead is acceptable for expected workloads.

### Context Switching

- Measured context switches during heavy load
- Average: 120 switches/second with 8 workers
- Impact: <2% performance degradation

**Finding:** Context switching overhead is minimal.

## Integration Challenges Identified

### Challenge 1: Job Granularity

**Issue:** Very small jobs (<100μs) have more overhead than benefit.

**Solution:**
- Batch small operations together
- Use threshold: only parallelize if work > 500μs
- Manual batching API for fine-grained control

**Impact:** Prevents performance degradation from over-parallelization.

### Challenge 2: Memory Allocation in Jobs

**Issue:** Allocating memory in parallel jobs causes GC contention.

**Solution:**
- Pre-allocate buffers before job dispatch
- Use object pools for frequently allocated types
- Frame allocator for temporary allocations

**Impact:** Reduces GC pressure from 15 collections/minute to 2.

### Challenge 3: Exception Handling

**Issue:** Unhandled exceptions in jobs crash worker threads.

**Solution:**
- Catch all exceptions at job boundary
- Store exception in JobHandle
- Rethrow on Wait() or when checking IsCompleted

**Impact:** Robust error handling without thread crashes.

## Refined Specifications

### Job System API

```csharp
// Basic job scheduling
JobHandle handle = JobSystem.Schedule(() => {
    // Work here
});

// Wait for completion
handle.Complete();

// Job with dependencies
JobHandle childJob = JobSystem.Schedule(() => {
    // Depends on handle completing first
}, dependency: handle);

// Batch processing
JobHandle batchJob = JobSystem.ScheduleBatch(
    items,
    (item) => ProcessItem(item),
    batchSize: 64
);

// Parallel for
JobSystem.ParallelFor(0, count, (i) => {
    // Process index i
});
```

### Configuration Parameters

```csharp
JobSystemConfig config = new JobSystemConfig
{
    WorkerCount = Environment.ProcessorCount - 1, // Leave 1 for main thread
    QueueCapacity = 4096,
    EnableWorkStealing = true,
    WorkStealingThreshold = 10, // Steal when >10 jobs in queue
    MinBatchSize = 1,
    MaxBatchSize = 256
};
```

### Performance Tuning Guidelines

1. **Batch Size Selection:**
   - CPU-bound work: 32-64 items
   - Memory-bound work: 128-256 items
   - IO-bound work: Use async instead

2. **Worker Count:**
   - Desktop: CPU count - 1
   - Server: CPU count (no GUI thread)
   - Mobile: 2-4 (balance battery and performance)

3. **Job Granularity:**
   - Target: 500μs - 5ms per job
   - Too small: overhead dominates
   - Too large: poor load balancing
