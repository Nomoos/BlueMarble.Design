# Phase 3 Validation Prototypes

This directory contains prototype specifications and validation documents for systems designed during Phase 3 research (Groups 41-46).

## Purpose

These prototypes serve to:
1. **Validate architectural decisions** from Phase 3 research
2. **Identify integration challenges** before full implementation
3. **Test performance assumptions** with simplified implementations
4. **Refine system interfaces** based on practical constraints
5. **Document lessons learned** for the implementation phase

## Prototype Status

### Core Infrastructure Prototypes

- [x] **Job System Prototype** - Multi-threaded task scheduler validation
- [x] **Memory Management Prototype** - Object pooling and allocation patterns
- [x] **Octree Prototype** - Spatial indexing performance validation

### Networking Prototypes

- [x] **State Synchronization Prototype** - Delta compression validation
- [x] **Client Prediction Prototype** - Prediction and reconciliation testing
- [x] **Interest Management Prototype** - AOI spatial queries validation

### Performance Prototypes

- [x] **C# Optimization Prototype** - GC pressure and allocation testing
- [x] **Streaming System Prototype** - Async loading validation

## How to Use These Prototypes

1. **Read the validation document** to understand what's being tested
2. **Review the test cases** to see expected vs actual results
3. **Check the lessons learned** for implementation guidance
4. **Reference the refined specifications** for the actual implementation

## Next Steps

After prototype validation:
1. Create detailed implementation specifications in `/docs`
2. Begin implementation of core infrastructure
3. Iterate based on prototype findings
4. Document any deviations from Phase 3 research
